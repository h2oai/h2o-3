\section{GLM Concepts}
Generalized linear models (GLM) are the workhorse for most predictive analysis use cases. GLM can be used for both
regression and classification, it scales well to large datasets, and is based on solid statistical background. It
is a generalization of linear models, allowing for modeling of data with exponential distributions and for
categorical data (classification). GLM models are fitted by solving the maximum likelihood optimization problem.

Generalized linear models are generalizations of linear regression models. Linear regression models the dependency
of response y on a vector of predictors x ($y \sim x^T \beta + \beta_0$). The models are built with the assumptions
that y has a gaussian distribution with a variance of $\sigma^2$ and the mean is a linear function of x with an
offset of some constant $\beta_0$, i.e. $ y = \mathcal{N}(x^T \beta + \beta_0 , \sigma^2) $. These assumptions can
be overly restrictive for real-world data that do not necessarily have a gaussian distribution.

GLM generalizes linear regression in the following ways: 

\begin{itemize} 
\item adding a non-linear link function that transforms the expectation of response variable, so that $link(y) \sim x^T \beta + \beta_0$.
\item allowing variance to depend on the predicted value by specifying the conditional distribution of the response variable or the family argument.
\end{itemize}

This generalization allows us to use GLM on problems such as binary classification (also known as logistic regression).

\subsection{GLM in H2O}
H2O's GLM algorithm fits the generalized linear model with elastic net penalties. The model fitting computation is
distributed, extremely fast, and scales extremely well for models with a limited number ($\mathtt{\sim}$ low
thousands) of predictors with non-zero coefficients. The algorithm can compute models for a single value of a
penalty argument or the full regularization path, similar to the glmnet package for R (refer
to \citetalias{glmnet}).  H2O's GLM fits the model by solving following problem:

\[ \min\limits_{\beta}\ (\ Classic GLM  + Regularization Penalty \ )\]

which is equivalent to:

\[ \min\limits_{\beta}\ (\ {{1\over{N}} log\_likelihood(family,\beta)  + \lambda (\alpha \| \beta \|_1} + {1- \alpha \over 2} \| \beta \|_2^2) \ )\]

\bigskip
The elastic net parameter $\alpha$ controls the penalty distribution between L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge Regression)
penalties. The range is any value between 0 and 1. When $\alpha$ = 0, we have no L1 penalty and the problem becomes
ridge regression. If $\alpha$ = 1, there is no L2 penalty and we have lasso.

The main advantage of an L1 penalty is that with sufficiently high $\lambda$, it produces a sparse solution; the
L2-only penalty does not reduce coefficients to exactly 0. The two penalties also differ in the case of correlated
predictors. The L2 penalty shrinks coefficients for correlated columns towards each other, while the L1 penalty
will pick one and drive the others to zero. Using the elastic net argument $\alpha$, you can combine these two
behaviors. It is also useful to always add a small L2 penalty to increase numerical stability.

Similarly to the methods discussed in \citetalias{glmnet}, H2O can compute the full regularization path, starting
from null-model (maximum penalty) going down to minimally penalized model. This search is made efficient by
employing strong-rules as described in \citetalias{strong} to filter out inactive coefficients (coefficients pushed
to zero by penalty). Computing the full regularization path is useful in that it gives more insight about the
importance of individual coefficients and quality of the model while allowing selection of the optimal amount of
penalization for the given problem and data.

\subsection{Model fitting}
GLM models are fitted by maximizing the likelihood. For the gaussian family, maximum likelihood is simply the
minimal mean squared error, which has an analytical solution and can be solved with ordinary least squares. For all
other families, the maximum likelihood problem has no analytical solution so we must use an iterative method such
as IRLSM, Newton method, gradient descent, or L-BFGS.

\subsection{Model validation}
Evaluating the quality of the model is a critical part of any data-modeling and scoring process. There are several
standard ways to evaluate the quality of the fitted GLM model; the most common method is to use the resulting
deviance. Deviance is calculated by comparing the log likelihood of the fitted model with log likelihood of the
saturated model (or theoretically perfect model).

\[ deviance = 2({ln(L_{s})} - {ln(L_{m})}) \]

Another metric frequently used for model selection is the Akaike information criterion (AIC). The AIC measures the
relative quality of a statistical model for a given set of data obtained by calculating the information loss after
replacing the original data with the model itself. Unlike deviance, which would assign a perfect value for the
saturated model and measures the absolute quality of the fit with a comparison against the null-hypothesis, AIC
takes into account the complexity of the given model. AIC is defined as follows:

\[ aic = 2(k - ln(L_{m}))\]

where k is the number of model parameters and $ln(L_{m})$ is the log likelihood of the fitted model over the data.

\subsection{Regularization} \label{regularization}
We introduce penalties to the model building process to avoid over-fitting, reduce variance of the prediction
error, and handle correlated predictors. There are two common penalized linear models: ridge regression and
lasso. Ridge regression provides greater numerical stability and is easier and faster to compute. In comparison,
lasso leads to a sparse solution, which is advantageous in many situations, as it can be used for feature selection
and to produce models with fewer parameters. When encountering highly correlated columns, the L2 penalty tends to
push all of the coefficients towards each other, while the L1 penalty will pick one and remove the others to
produce 0 coefficients.

\subsubsection{Lasso and Ridge regression}

Lasso represents the L1 penalty and is an alternative regularized least squares method that uses the constraint
$||B||_1$. The penalty is configured using the \texttt{alpha} parameter. The main difference between lasso and
ridge regression is that as the penalty for ridge regression increases, the parameters are reduced to non-zero
values. With lasso, if the penalty is increased, the parameters can be reduced to zero values. Since reducing
parameters to zero removes them from the model, the lasso method provides only the relevant data. Ridge regression
never removes any data.

\subsubsection{Elastic net penalty}

H2O supports elastic net regularization which is parametrized by \texttt{alpha} and \texttt{lambda} arguments
(similar to \citetalias{glmnet})

The \texttt{alpha} argument controls the elastic net penalty distribution to L1 and L2 norms. It can have any value
in the [0,1] range (inclusive) or a vector of values (triggers grid search). If \texttt{alpha = 0}, the result
is \textbf{Ridge Regression}, while if \texttt{alpha = 1} the result is \textbf{LASSO}.

The \texttt{lambda} argument controls the penalty strength; the range is any positive value or a vector of values
(which triggers grid search).

\textbf{Note:} Lambda values are capped at $\lambda_{max}$, which is the smallest $\lambda$ s.t. the solution is
empty model (all zeros except for intercept).

Elastic net combines the two and adds another parameter, $\alpha$, which controls the distribution of the penalty
between L1 and L2. The combination of the two penalties is beneficial, since L1 gives sparsity while L2 gives
stability and encourages the grouping effect (where a group of correlated variables tends to be dropped or added
into the model all at once). One possible use of the $\alpha$ argument is for lasso with very little L2 penalty
($\alpha$ almost 1) to stabilize the computation and improve convergence speed.

A model-fitting problem with an elastic net penalty becomes:

\[ \min\limits_{\beta,\beta_0}\ {{1\over{N}} ln(L(family,\beta,\beta_0))  + \lambda (\alpha \| \beta \|_1}  + {1- \alpha \over 2} \| \beta \|_2^2) \]

\subsection{GLM model families}
The following subsection describes the GLM families supported in H2O. 

\subsubsection{Linear regression (Gaussian family)}
Linear regression refers to the gaussian family model. It is the simplest example of GLM, but it has many uses and
several advantages over the other families, such as faster and more stable computation.

It models the dependency as a purely linear function (with link = identity):
\[ \hat{y} = x^T\beta + \beta_0\]

The model is fitted by solving the least squares problem (maximum likelihood for gaussian family):

\[ \min\limits_{\beta,\beta_0} { {1 \over 2N}\sum\limits_{i=1}\limits^{N}(x_i^{T}\beta  + \beta_0- y_i)^T (x_i^{T}\beta + \beta_0 - y_i)  + \lambda (\alpha \|\beta \|_1 + {1-\alpha \over 2}) \| \beta \|_2^2} \]

Deviance is simply the sum of squared errors:
\[ D = \sum\limits_{i=1}\limits^{N}{(y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2} \]

\waterExampleInR

Included in the H2O package is a prostate cancer data set. The data was collected by Dr. Donn Young at Ohio State
University Comprehensive Cancer Center for a study of patients with varying degrees of prostate cancer. The
following example illustrates how to build a model to predict the volume (VOL) of tumors obtained from ultrasounds
based on features such as age and race.

\waterExampleInPython
\lstinputlisting[style=python]{glm/glm_gaussian_example.py}

\subsubsection{Logistic regression (Binomial family)}
Logistic regression can be used for a binary classification problem where the response is categorical with two
levels. It models dependency as $Pr(y = 1|x)$. The canonical link for binomial family is logit (log of the odds)
and its inverse is a logistic function that takes any real number on the input and projects it onto the 0,1 range
(s-curve).  The s-curve is shown below:

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{images/scurve.png}
\end{figure}

\[ \hat{y} = Pr(y = 1|x) = {e^{x^T\beta + \beta_0} \over 1 + e^{x^T \beta + \beta_0} } \]

or alternatively:

\[log {\hat{y} \over 1- \hat{y}} = log{Pr(y=1|x) \over Pr(y=0|x)} = x^T \beta + \beta_0\]

The model is fitted by solving:
\[  \min\limits_{\beta,\beta_0} { {1 \over N}\sum\limits_{i=1}\limits^{N}(y_i (x_i^{T}\beta  + \beta_0) - log (1 + e^{x_i^{T}\beta  + \beta_0} )  + \lambda (\alpha \|\beta \|_1 + {1-\alpha \over 2}) \| \beta \|_2^2} \]

Deviance is -2 log likelihood:
\[D = -2\sum\limits_{i=1}\limits^{N}{(y log(\hat{y}) + (1 - y)log(1-\hat{y})  )}\]

\waterExampleInR

Using the prostate data set, build a binomial model that classifies if there is penetration of the prostatic
capsule (CAPSULE). Make sure the entries in the CAPSULE column are binary entries by using the \texttt{h2o.table()}
function. Change the regression by setting the family to binomial.

\lstinputlisting[style=R]{glm/glm_binomial_example.R}

\waterExampleInPython
\lstinputlisting[style=python]{glm/glm_binomial_example.py}

\subsubsection{Poisson models}
Poisson regression is generally used in cases where the response represents counts and we assume errors have a
Poisson distribution. In general, it can be applied to any data where the response is non-negative.

When building a Poisson model, we usually model dependency of the mean on the log scale, i.e. canonical link is log
and prediction is:

\[\hat{y} = e^{x^T\beta + \beta_0}\]

The model is fitted by solving:

\[  \min\limits_{\beta,\beta_0} { {1 \over N}\sum\limits_{i=1}\limits^{N}(y_i (x_i^{T}\beta  + \beta_0) - e^{x_i^{T}\beta  + \beta_0})  + \lambda (\alpha \|\beta \|_1 + {1-\alpha \over 2}) \| \beta \|_2^2} \]

Deviance is:

\[D = -2\sum\limits_{i=1}\limits^{N}{(y log(\hat{y}) - y - \hat{y}}\]

\waterExampleInR

Load the Insurance data from the MASS library and import into H2O. Run a poisson model that predicts the number of
claims (Claims) based on the district of the policy holder (District), their age (Age), and the type of car they
own (Group).

\lstinputlisting[style=R]{glm/glm_poisson_example.R}

\waterExampleInPython
\lstinputlisting[style=python]{glm/glm_poisson_example.py}

\subsubsection{Gamma models}
The gamma distribution is useful for modeling a positive continuous response variable, where the conditional
variance of the response grows with its mean but the coefficient of variation of the response $\sigma^2(x)/μ(x)$ is
constant for all x, i.e., it has a constant coefficient of variation.

It is usually used with inverse or log link, inverse is the canonical link.

The model is fitted by solving:

\[  \min\limits_{\beta,\beta_0} { {1 \over N}\sum\limits_{i=1}\limits^{N}{y_i \over (x_i^{T}\beta  + \beta_0)} - log({x_i^{T}\beta  + \beta_0})  + \lambda (\alpha \|\beta \|_1 + {1-\alpha \over 2}) \| \beta \|_2^2} \]

Deviance is:

\[D = -2\sum\limits_{i=1}\limits^{N}{log({y_i \over \hat{y}_i}) - {y_i - \hat{y}_i \over\hat{y}_i }}\]

\waterExampleInR

To change the link function from the default inverse function to the log link function, modify the \texttt{link}
argument.

\section{Building GLM Models in H2O}

H2O's GLM implementation presents a high-performance distributed algorithm, which scales linearly with the number
of rows and works extremely well for datasets with a limited number of active predictors.

\subsection{Classification vs. regression}

GLM can produce both two categories of model, classification (binary classification only) and regression.  (Binary
classification in GLM is also called logistic regression.)

The data type of the response column determines the model category.  If the response data type is a categorical
(also called a factor or an enum) then a classification model will be created.  If the response column data type is
numeric (either integer or real), then a regression model will be created.

The following examples show how to coerce the data type of a column to a factor.

\bigskip
\waterExampleInR
\lstinputlisting[style=R]{glm/coerce_column_to_factor.R}

\waterExampleInPython
\lstinputlisting[style=python]{glm/coerce_column_to_factor.py}

\subsection{Training and validation frames}

The word Frame in this context refers to an H2OFrame, the fundamental way of storing data in H2O's distributed memory.

\texttt{training\_frame} refers to a frame containing a training dataset.  All predictors and the response (as
well as offset and weights, if specified) must be part of this frame.

\texttt{validation\_frame} refers to an optional frame containing a validation dataset.  If specified, this 
frame must have the exact same columns as the training dataset.  Metrics are calculated on the validation dataset
for convenience purposes.

Note there are functions to calculate the same metrics after the model training completes for the case when a
validation dataset is not provided up front during training.

\subsection{Predictor and response variables}

Every model must specify its predictors and response.  Predictors and response are specified by the \texttt{x},
and \texttt{y} parameters.

\texttt{x} contains the list of column names or column indices referring to vectors from the training frame; it can
not contain periods.

\texttt{y} is a column name or index referring to a vector from the training frame.

\subsubsection{Categorical variables}

If the response column is a categorical, then a classification model will be created.  GLM only supports binomial
classification, meaning the response column may only have two levels.

Predictor columns that are categorical may have more than two levels.

Users are encouraged to let GLM expand categorical columns itself.  GLM can take advantage of the categorical
column for better performance and memory utilization.

\textbf{Avoid one-hot encoding} categorical columns with many levels into many binary columns!  This is very
inefficient.  (This is especially true for Python users, who are used to expanding their categorical variables
manually for other frameworks.)

\subsection{Family and link}

Family and Link are both optional parameters. The default family is \texttt{Gaussian} and the default link is a
canonical link for the selected family. These are passed in as strings, e.g. \texttt{family=`gamma', link = `log'}.
While it is possible to select something other than a canonical link, doing so can lead to an unstable
computation. Recommended combinations are:

\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{Gaussian} and \texttt{Log}
\item \texttt{Inverse, Gamma,} and \texttt{Log}
\end{itemize} 

\subsection{Regularization parameters}

See Section \ref{regularization} above for a detailed explanation.

To get the best possible model, we need to find the optimal values of the regularization parameters $\alpha$ and
$\lambda$.  To find the optimal values, H2O provides grid search over $\alpha$ and a special form of grid search
called ``lambda search over $\lambda$". The recommended way to find optimal regularization settings on H2O is to do
a grid search over a few $\alpha$ values with an automatic lambda search for each $\alpha$. Both are described
below in greater detail.

\subsubsection{alpha and lambda}

\texttt{alpha} controls the distribution between L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge regression) penalties.  An \texttt{alpha} 
of 1.0 means only lasso, and an \texttt{alpha} of 0.0 means only ridge.

\texttt{lambda} controls the amount of regularization applied.  For a \texttt{lambda} value of 0.0, no 
regularization is applied, and the \texttt{alpha} parameter is ignored.  The default value for \texttt{lambda} is
calculated by H2O using a heuristic based on the training data.  If you let H2O calculate \texttt{lambda}, you can
see the chosen value in the model output.

\subsubsection{lambda search}

Lambda search is a special case of automatic and efficient grid search over lambda argument and is described in its
own section. Lambda search can be enabled by using the \texttt{lambda\_search = T} option. It can be further
parametrized by the \texttt{nlambdas} and \texttt{lambda\_min\_ratio} parameters.
\texttt{nlambdas} specifies the number of lambda values on the regularization path and \texttt{lambda\_min\_ratio} 
specifies the minimal lambda value to be computed as a ration of $\lambda_{max}$.

Lambda search can be enabled by using the \texttt{lambda\_search = T} option. It can be further parametrized by
the \texttt{nlambdas} and \texttt{lambda\_min\_ratio} parameters. When this option is enabled, H2O performs a
specialized grid search over the list of \texttt{nlambdas} $\lambda$ values, producing one model for each $\lambda$
value.

The $\lambda$-list is automatically generated as an exponentially decreasing sequence, going from $\lambda_{max}$,
the smallest $\lambda$ such that the solution is a model with all 0s, to $\lambda_{min} =
$ \textit{lambda\_min\_ratio} * $ \lambda_{max}$.

H2O computes $\lambda$-models sequentially and in decreasing order, warm-starting (using the previous solution as
the initial prediction) the model for $\lambda_k$ with the solution for $\lambda_{k-1}$. By warm-starting the
models, we get better performance: typically models for subsequent $\lambda$s are close to each other, so we need
only a few iterations per $\lambda$ (typically 2 or 3). We also achieve greater numerical stability, since models
with a higher penalty are easier to compute, so we start with an easy problem and then keep making only small
changes to it.

\textbf{Note:} \texttt{nlambda} and \texttt{lambda\_min\_ratio} also specify the relative distance of any two
 lambdas in the sequence. This is important when applying recursive strong rules, which are only effective if the
neighboring lambdas are ``close" to each other. The default values are \texttt{nlambda} = 100 and $\lambda_{min}
= \lambda_{max} 1e^{-4}$, which gives us the ratio of 0.912.  For best results when using strong rules, keep the
ratio close to the default.

\subsection{Handling wide data and building sparse models}

H2O's GLM offers two different approaches to handling wide datasets:  L1 regularization and the L\_BFGS solver.

Quick recommendations:

\begin{itemize}
\item For a sparse solution (i.e. some predictors are dropped from the final model), use the IRLSM solver with 
      \texttt{alpha} greater than 0.0 (so you get at least some L1 penalty) and enable \texttt{lambda\_search}.

\item For a dense solution (i.e. all predictors are in the final model), use the L\_BFGS solver with
      \texttt{alpha} of 1.0 so there is no L1 penalty, only L2 penalty.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Solver selection}

The two solvers provided in H2O are Iterative Reweighted Least Squares Method (IRLSM) and L\_BFGS.  IRLSM uses
a Gram Matrix approach underneath the hood, which is very efficient for tall and narrow datasets.  For wider 
datasets (thousands of predictors and up), the L\_BFGS solver scales better.

Note that when using the L\_BFGS solver, for performance reasons, we recommend not using any L1 penalty, since
model building can be slowed down.

You may use \texttt{lambda\_search} with both the IRLSM and L\_BFGS solvers.

\subsubsection{L1 regularization (Lasso)}

GLM can build sparse models (i.e. models which have fewer coefficients than input predictors) when L1 penalty is
enabled (i.e. \texttt{alpha} is less than 1.0).

Strong rules for L1 (see Section \ref{strongrules}) are a performance optimization enabled automatically by H2O
internally (there is no parameter for strong rules).  They are generally only effective when
\texttt{lambda\_search} is enabled.

\subsubsection{Stopping criteria}

When using L1 penalty with lambda search, you can specify the \texttt{max\_active\_predictors} parameter to stop
the search early.  The models built at the beginning of the lambda search have higher values of lambda, consider
fewer predictors and take less time to calculate the model.  Models built at the end of the lambda search have
lower values of lambda, incorporate more predictors, and take a longer time to calculate the model.

\bigskip
\waterExampleInR
\lstinputlisting[style=R]{glm/glm_stopping_criteria.R}

\waterExampleInPython
\lstinputlisting[style=python]{glm/glm_stopping_criteria.py}

You can also set the \texttt{nlambdas} parameter for a lambda search to fix the number of models attempted across
the search.

\subsection{Advanced features}

H2O's GLM has several advanced features to help build better models.

\subsubsection{Standardizing data}

The \texttt{standardize} parameter is true by default.  This will standardize numeric columns to have zero mean and
unit variance.  Note this parameter must be true to produce standardized coefficient magnitudes in the model
output.

We recommend keeping standardization on when using regularization (i.e. \texttt{lambda} is chosen by H2O or set by
the user to be greater than 0).

Only advanced users should turn standardization off.

\subsubsection{N-fold cross validation}

All validation values can be computed using either the training data set (the default option) or using N-fold
cross-validation (\texttt{nfolds $> 1$)}. When N-fold cross-validation is enabled, H2O randomly splits data into n
equally-sized parts, trains each of the n models on n-1 parts, and computes validation on the part that was not
used for training.

\bigskip
\waterExampleInR
\lstinputlisting[style=R]{glm/glm_cross_validation.R}

You can also optionally control which rows are assigned to which fold with the \texttt{fold\_assignment}
or \texttt{fold\_column} parameters.

\subsubsection{Grid search over alpha}

Alpha search is not always needed and simply changing its value to 0.5 (or 0 or 1 if we only want Ridge or Lasso,
respectively) works in most cases. If $\alpha$ search is needed, usually only a few values are sufficient. Alpha
search is invoked by supplying a list of values for $\alpha$ instead of a single value. H2O then produces one model
per $\alpha$ value. The grid search computation can be done in parallel (depending on the cluster resources) and it
is generally more efficient than computing different models separately from R.

Use caution when including $\alpha=0$ or $\alpha=1$ in the grid search. $\alpha=0$ will produce a dense solution
and it can be really slow (or even impossible) to compute in large N situations. $\alpha=1$ has no L2 penalty, so
it is therefore less numerically stable and can be very slow as well due to slower convergence. In general, it is
safer to run with $alpha=1-\epsilon$ instead.

\bigskip
\waterExampleInR
\lstinputlisting[style=R]{glm/glm_grid_search_over_alpha.R}

\subsubsection{Grid search over lambda}

While automatic lambda search is the preferred method, it is also possible to do a grid search over lambda values
with lambda-search disabled.

\bigskip
\waterExampleInR
\lstinputlisting[style=R]{glm/glm_grid_search_over_lambda.R}

\subsubsection{Offsets}

\texttt{offset\_column} is an optional column name or index referring to a column in the training frame.

This column specifies a prior known component to be included in the linear predictor during training.

\subsubsection{Row weights}

\texttt{weights\_column} is an optional column name or index referring to a column in the training frame.

This column specifies on a per-row basis the weight of that row.  If no weight column is specified, a default value
of 1 is used for each row.

\subsubsection{Coefficient constraints}

Coefficient constraints allow you to set special conditions over the model coefficients. Currently supported
constraints are upper and lower bounds and the proximal operator interface, as described in \citetalias{prox}.

The constraints are specified as a frame with following vecs (matched by name; all vecs can be sparse):

\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{names (mandatory)}  - coefficient names. 
\item \texttt{lower\_bounds (optional)} - coefficient lower bounds , must be $<= 0$
\item \texttt{upper\_bounds (optional)} - coefficient upper bounds , must be $>= 0$
\item \texttt{beta\_given (optional)} - specifies the given solution in proximal operator interface
\item \texttt{rho} (mandatory if \texttt{beta\_given} is specified, otherwise ignored) - specifies per-column L2 penalties on the distance from the given solution
\end{itemize}
 
\subsubsection{Proximal operators}

The proximal operator interface allows you to run the GLM with a proximal penalty on a distance from a specified
given solution. There are many potential uses: for example, it can be used as part of an ADMM consensus algorithm
to obtain a unified solution over separate H2O clouds, or in Bayesian regression approximation.

\subsection{Coefficients and normalized coefficients}

Coefficients are the predictor weights (i.e. the actual model used for prediction).  Coefficients should be used to
make predictions for new data points:

\lstinputlisting[style=R]{glm/glm_model_output_20.R}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=output]
  Intercept         AGE        RACE         PSA     GLEASON 
-6.46739299 -0.02198278 -0.29576986  0.02855057  1.15680761 
\end{lstlisting}

If the \texttt{standardize} option is enabled, H2O returns another set of coefficients, the standardized
coefficients. These are the predictor weights of the standardized data and are included only for informational
purposes (e.g. to compare relative variable importance). In this case, the ``normal'' coefficients are obtained
from the standardized coefficients by \textbf{reversing} the data standardization process (de-scaled, with the
intercept adjusted by an added offset) so that they can be applied to data in its original form (i.e. no
standardization prior to scoring). \textbf{Note:} These are \textbf{not} the same as coefficients of a model built
on non-standardized data.

Standardized coefficients are useful for comparing the relative contribution of different predictors to the
model:

\lstinputlisting[style=R]{glm/glm_model_output_30.R}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=output]
Coefficients:
      names coefficients standardized_coefficients
1 Intercept    -6.467393                 -0.414440
2       AGE    -0.021983                 -0.143745
3      RACE    -0.295770                 -0.093423
4       PSA     0.028551                  0.604644
5   GLEASON     1.156808                  1.298815
\end{lstlisting}

This view provides a sorted list of standardized coefficients in descending order for easy comparison:

\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Model statistics}

Various model statistics are available:

\texttt{MSE} is the mean squared error.  TODO

\texttt{R\textasciicircum2} is the R squared.  TODO

\texttt{LogLoss} is the log loss.  TODO

\texttt{AUC} is based on ROC curve build  by summing up confusion matrices built for all n-models.
For each threshold, we get a confusion matrix that includes all the rows from the training set. However, each row
is classified exclusively by the model that did not contain that row in its training set. The computation of AUC is
the same as for a model without cross-validation.

\texttt{Gini}  TODO

\texttt{Null deviance} is sum of null deviances of n-models (each uses null model based on the subset of the data)

\texttt{Residual deviance} is sum of residual deviances of all n-models

\texttt{AIC} is based on log-likelihood, which is summed up similarly to deviance

Fetch these statistics using the following accessor functions:

\section{Making Predictions}

Once you have built a model, you can use it to make predictions using two different approaches:  the in-H2O batch
scoring approach and the real-time NanoFast POJO approach.

\subsection{Batch in-H2O predictions}

Batch in-H2O predictions are made using a normal H2O cluster on a new H2OFrame.  In addition to predictions, you
can also get metrics like AUC if you include the response column in the new data.  See an example for logistic
regression (i.e. binomial classification) below.

\bigskip
\waterExampleInR

\lstinputlisting[style=R]{glm/glm_binomial_predictions_with_response.R}

Here is an example of just making predictions on new data:

\lstinputlisting[style=R]{glm/glm_binomial_predictions_without_response.R}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=output]
  predict        p0        p1
1       1 0.1676892 0.8323108
2       0 0.4824181 0.5175819
3       1 0.2000061 0.7999939
4       0 0.9242169 0.0757831
5       0 0.5044669 0.4955331
6       0 0.7272743 0.2727257
\end{lstlisting}

The three columns in the prediction file are the predicted class, the probability that the prediction is class 0
and the probability that the prediction is class 1.

The predicted class is chosen based on the maximum-F1 threshold.

You can change the threshold manually, for example to 0.3, and recalculate the predict column like this:

\lstinputlisting[style=R]{glm/glm_recalculate_predict.R}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=output]
  predict        p0        p1
1       1 0.1676892 0.8323108
2       1 0.4824181 0.5175819
3       1 0.2000061 0.7999939
4       0 0.9242169 0.0757831
5       1 0.5044669 0.4955331
6       0 0.7272743 0.2727257
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Real-time low-latency predictions with the NanoFast scoring engine}

For NanoFast scoring, H2O GLM models can be directly rendered as a Plain Old Java Object (POJO).  These are very
low latency, and can easily be embedded in any Java environment (a customer-facing web application, a Storm bolt,
or a Spark Streaming pipeline, for example).

The POJO does nothing but pure math, and has no dependencies on any other software packages (not even H2O itself),
so it is easy to work with.

Directions for using the POJO in detail are beyond the scope of this document, but here is an example of how to get
one and view it.  You can also access the POJO from the Flow Web UI.

\section{Best Practices}

Here are a few rules of thumb to follow:

\begin{itemize}
\item IRLSM solver works best on tall and skinny datasets
\item If you have a wide dataset, use L1 penalty to eliminate columns from the model
\item If you have a wide dataset, try the L\_BFGS solver
\item Try lambda search
      \begin{itemize}
      \item But specify \texttt{max\_predictors} if it is taking too long
      \item 90\% of the time is spent on the larger models with the small lambdas, so specifying \texttt{max\_predictors} helps a lot
      \end{itemize}
\item Keep a little bit of L2 penalty (i.e. ridge regression) for numerical stability (i.e. don’t use \texttt{alpha} 1.0, use 0.95 instead)
\item Use symmetric nodes in your H2O cluster
\item For IRLSM solver, bigger nodes can help the ADMM / Cholesky decomposition run faster
\item Impute if you need to before running GLM
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Sanity checking the model}

Here are some things to look for to double-check whether you got a good model:

\begin{itemize}
\item Look for suspiciously different cross-validation results between folds

\waterExampleInR
\lstinputlisting[style=R]{glm/glm_compare_cross_validation_folds.R}

\item Look for explained deviance

TODO: How?

      \begin{itemize}
      \item Too close to 0:  model doesn’t predict well
      \item Too close to 1:  model predicts “too” well (one of your input columnss is probably a cheating column)
      \end{itemize}
\item For logistic regression (i.e. binomial classification) models, look for AUC
      \begin{itemize}
      \item Too close to 0.5:  model doesn’t predict well
      \item Too close to 1:  model predicts “too” well
      \end{itemize}
\item Look at the number\_of\_iterations or scoring history to see if GLM stops early for a particular
      lambda that interests you (performing all the iterations probably means the solution is not good).  This is
      controlled by the \texttt{max\_iterations} parameter.
\item Too many NAs in your training data is bad (GLM discards rows with NA values)

TODO: How to tell how many training rows were used to build the model?

      \begin{itemize}
      \item If you have a really bad column, you might accidentally be losing all your rows.
      \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

%----------------------------------------------------------------------

\section{Implementation Details}

The following sections discuss some of the implementation choices in H2O's GLM.

\subsection{Categorical variables}

When applying linear models to datasets with categorical variables, the usual approach is to expand the
categoricals into a set of binary vectors, with one vector per each categorical level (e.g. by calling
{\texttt{model.matrix}} in R). H2O performs similar expansions automatically and no prior changes to the dataset
are needed. Each categorical column is treated as a set of sparse binary vectors.

\subsubsection{Largest categorical speed optimization}

Categoricals have special handling during GLM computation as well. When forming the gram matrix, we can take
advantage of the fact that columns belonging to the same categorical never co-occur and the gram matrix region
belonging to these columns will not have any non-zero elements outside of the diagonal. We can thus keep it in
sparse representation, taking only O(N) elements instead of O(N*N). Furthermore, the complexity of Choelsky
decomposition of a matrix that starts with a diagonal region can be greatly reduced. H2O's GLM exploits these two
facts to handle the largest categorical ``for free". Therefore, when analyzing the performance of GLM in the
equation expressed above, we can subtract the size of the largest categoricals from the number of predictors.

$$N = \sum_{c \in C} (\|c.domain\|) - \arg\max_{c \in C} \|c.domain\| + \|Nums\| $$

\subsection{Speed and memory performance characteristics}

This section discusses the CPU and memory cost of running GLM for each available solver.

\subsubsection{IRLSM solver}

The implementation is based on iterative re-weighted least squares with an ADMM inner solver (as described
in \citetalias{admm}) to deal with the L1 penalty. Every iteration of the algorithm consists of following steps:

\begin{enumerate} 
\item Generate weighted least squares problem based on previous solution, i.e. vector of weights w and response z 
\item Compute the weighted gram matrix $X^TWX$ and $X^Tz$ vector
\item Decompose the gram matrix (Cholesky decomposition) and apply ADMM solver to solve the L1 penalized least squares problem
\end{enumerate}

Steps 1 and 2 are performed distributively and step 3 is computed in parallel on a single node. We can thus
characterize the computational complexity and scalability of dataset with M observations and N columns (predictors)
on a cluster with n nodes with p CPUs each as follows:

\bigskip

\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{ c || c | c }
        & & \\
        & CPU & Memory \\
        & & \\
        \hline
        \hline
        & & \\

        \begin{tabular}{@{}c@{}}Gram matrix ($ X^TX $) \\ (distributed)\end{tabular} &
        $ O(\dfrac{MN^2}{pn}) $ &
        \begin{tabular}{@{}c@{}} $O($training data$)$ + $O($gram matrix$)$ \\ $ O(MN) $ + $ O(N^2pn) $ \end{tabular}
        \\

        & & \\
        \hline
        & & \\

        \begin{tabular}{@{}c@{}}ADMM + Cholesky decomposition \\ (single node)\end{tabular} &
        $ O(\dfrac{N^3}{p}) $ &
        $ O(N^2) $
        \\

        & & \\
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}

\bigskip

\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{ l l }
    M & Number of rows in the training data \\
    N & Number of predictors in the training data \\
    p & Number of CPUs per node \\
    n & Number of nodes in the cluster \\
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}

\bigskip

If $M >> N$, the algorithm scales linearly both in the number of nodes and the number of CPUs per node. However,
the algorithm is limited in the number of predictors it can handle, since the size of the Gram matrix grows
quadratically due to a memory and network throughput issue with the number of predictors, and its decomposition
cost grows as the cube of the number of predictors (which is a computational cost issue). In many cases, H2O can
work around these limitations due to its handling of categoricals and by employing strong rules to filter out
inactive predictors.

\subsubsection{L\_BFGS solver}

TODO

\subsection{Data corner cases}

TODO

\begin{itemize}
\item What if: the training data has an NA?

\item What if: the test data has an NA?

\item What if: a predictor column is categorical, you are making predictions on test data, and the predictor is
a level that wasn't seen during training?

\item What if: the response column is categorical, you are making predictions on test data, and the response is
a level that wasn't seen during training?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Strong rules for L1} \label{strongrules}

H2O's GLM employs strong rules (as described in \citetalias{strong}) to discard predictors that are likely to have
0 coefficients prior to model building. According to \citetalias{strong}, we can identify these predictors based on
a gradient with great accuracy. This provides very few false negatives and virtually no false positives in
practice, greatly reducing the computational complexity of model fitting and enabling it to run on wide datasets
with tens of thousands of predictors, provided that there is a limited number of active predictors.

When applying the strong rules, we evaluate the gradient at the starting solution, filter out inactive
coefficients, and fit a model using only a subset of the available predictors. Since strong rules may have false
positives (which are extremely rare in practice), we need to check the solution by testing the kkt conditions and
verify that all discarded predictors indeed have 0 coefficients.

\item \texttt{beta\_constraints}: A data frame or \texttt{H2OParsedData} object with the columns \texttt{["names", "lower\_bounds", "upper\_bounds", "beta\_given"]}, where each row corresponds to a predictor in the GLM. \texttt{"names"} contains the predictor names, \texttt{"lower\_bounds"/"upper\_bounds"} are the lower and upper bounds (respectively) of the beta, and \texttt{"beta\_given"} is a user-specified starting value. 
\item \texttt{offset\_column}: Specify the offset column. Note: Offsets are per-row “bias values” that are used during model training. For Gaussian distributions, they can be seen as simple corrections to the response (y) column. Instead of learning to predict the response (y-row), the model learns to predict the (row) offset of the response column. For other distributions, the offset corrections are applied in the linearized space before applying the inverse link function to get the actual response values. 
\item \texttt{weights\_column}: Specify the weights column. Note: Weights are per-row observation weights. This is typically the number of times a row is repeated, but non-integer values are supported as well. During training, rows with higher weights matter more, due to the larger loss function pre-factor.
\item \texttt{intercept}: Logical; includes a constant term (intercept) in the model. If there are factor columns in your model, then the intercept must be included. %% <--- still true? copied from `has_intercept`

%Additional: 
%Strong Rules Enables: Uses strong rules to filter out inactive columns. Default is true.
%Ignored_cols: No default.
%Non-negative: Restricts coefficients to be non-negative. Default is false.
%parallelism: @Is this just a python thing?
