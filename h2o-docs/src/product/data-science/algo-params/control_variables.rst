``control_variables``
--------------------

- Available in: GLM
- Hyperparameter: no

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Control variables are special predictors that are included during model training but automatically excluded during inference/scoring. This feature allows you to account for certain factors during training without having them affect predictions.

Common use cases include:

- Accounting for batch effects or experimental conditions
- Controlling for confounding variables
- Incorporating fixed effects that won't be available at prediction time

When control variables are specified, GLM will exclude them during scoring. Model metrics and scoring history are calculated for both the restricted model (with control variables excluded) and the unrestricted model (with control variables included).

To get the unrestricted model with its own metrics use ``glm.make_unrestriced_glm_model()``/``h2o.make_unrestricted_glm_model(glm)``.


**Notes**:

- This option is applicable only for regression and binomial distribution.
- This option is not available when cross validation is enabled.
- This option is not available when Lambda search is enabled.
