- Available in: GBM, DRF, Deep Learning, GLM, HGLM, PCA, GLRM, Na√Øve-Bayes, K-Means, AutoML, XGBoost, Word2vec, Isolation Forest, Stacked Ensembles, Uplift DRF, ANOVAGLM, ModelSelection
- Hyperparameter: yes

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

**Model Building**

When building a model, this option specifes the maximum runtime in seconds that you want to allot in order to complete the model. If this maximum runtime is exceeded before the model build is completed, then the model will fail. 

**Using with Grid Search**

When performing a grid search, this option specifies the maximum runtime in seconds for the entire grid. This option can also be combined with ``max_runtime_secs`` in the model parameters. If ``max_runtime_secs`` is not set in the model parameters, then each model build is launched with a limit equal to the remainder of the grid time. On the other hand, if ``max_runtime_secs`` is set in the model parameters, then each build is launched with a limit equal to the minimum of the model time limit and the remaining time for the grid.

Specifying ``max_runtime_secs=0`` disables this option, thus allowing for an unlimited amount of runtime.

.. warning::
	``max_runtime_secs`` cannot always produce a reproducible model for GBM, DRF, XGBoost, Isolation Forest, or Uplift DRF.
