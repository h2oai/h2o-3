Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Use this option to specify a response column (y-axis). The response column is the column that you are attempting to predict. For example, based on a set of parameters in a training dataset, will a new customber be more or less likely to purchase a product? Or based on some known variables, what is the likelihood that a flight will be delayed? In both cases, a model can be applied to a training frame and to a validation frame to predict the likely response.  

**Response Columns with DL and GBM Distribution**

Response columns can be numeric or categorical, and they can be binomial or multiomial. If you are specifying a distribution type in DL or GBM, however, then keep in mind the following when defining a response column:

- If the distribution is ``bernoulli``, the the response column must be 2-class categorical
- If the distribution is ``multinomial``, the response column must be categorical.
- If the distribution is ``poisson``, the response column must be numeric.
- If the distribution is ``laplace``, the response column must be numeric.
- If the distribution is ``tweedie``, the response column must be numeric.
- If the distribution is ``gaussian``, the response column must be numeric.
- If the distribution is ``huber``, the response column must be numeric.
- If the distribution is ``gamma``, the response column must be numeric.
- If the distribution is ``quantile``, the response column must be numeric.

**Response Columns with GLM Family**

In GLM, you can specify one of the following family options based on the response column type:

- ``gaussian``: The data must be numeric (Real or Int). This is the default family.
- ``binomial``: The data must be categorical 2 levels/classes or binary (Enum or Int).
- ``quasibinomial``: The data must be numeric.
- ``multinomial``: The data can be categorical with more than two levels/classes (Enum).
- ``poisson``: The data must be numeric and non-negative (Int).
- ``gamma``: The data must be numeric and continuous and positive (Real or Int).
- ``tweedie``: The data must be numeric and continuous (Real) and non-negative.
- ``ordinal``: Requires a categorical response with at least 3 levels. (For 2-class problems use family="binomial".)

**Notes**: 

- The response column cannot be the same as the `fold_column <fold_column.html>`__. 
- For supervised learning, the response column cannot be the same as the `weights_column <weights_column.html>`__, and the response column must exist in both the training frame and in the validation frame.
