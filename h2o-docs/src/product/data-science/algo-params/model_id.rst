Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

When building a model, H2O automatically generates a destination key as a unique identifier for the model. You can optionally use this option to specify a custom name for your model.

		# import the cars dataset:
		# this dataset is used to classify whether or not a car is economical based on
		# the car's displacement, power, weight, and acceleration, and the year it was made
		cars <- h2o.importFile("https://s3.amazonaws.com/h2o-public-test-data/smalldata/junit/cars_20mpg.csv")

		# convert response column to a factor
		cars["economy_20mpg"] <- as.factor(cars["economy_20mpg"])

		# split into train and validation sets
		cars_split <- h2o.splitFrame(data = cars, ratios = 0.8, seed = 1234)
