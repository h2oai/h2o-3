Deep Learning (Neural Networks)
-------------------------------

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

H2Oâ€™s Deep Learning is based on a multi-layer `feedforward artificial neural network <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedforward_neural_network>`__ that is trained with stochastic gradient descent using back-propagation. The network can contain a large number of hidden layers consisting of neurons with tanh, rectifier, and maxout activation functions. Advanced features such as adaptive learning rate, rate annealing, momentum training, dropout, L1 or L2 regularization, checkpointing, and grid search enable high predictive accuracy. Each compute node trains a copy of the global model parameters on its local data with multi-threading (asynchronously) and contributes periodically to the global model via model averaging across the network.

A feedforward artificial neural network (ANN) model, also known as deep neural network (DNN) or multi-layer perceptron (MLP), is the most common type of Deep Neural Network and the only type that is supported natively in H2O-3. Several other types of DNNs are popular as well, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). MLPs work well on transactional (tabular) data; however if you have image data, then CNNs are a great choice. If you have sequential data (e.g. text, audio, time-series), then RNNs are a good choice.

Defining a Deep Learning Model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

H2O Deep Learning models have many input parameters, many of which are only accessible via the expert mode. For most cases, use the default values. Please read the following instructions before building extensive Deep Learning models. The application of grid search and successive continuation of winning models via checkpoint restart is highly recommended, as model performance can vary greatly.

Parameters are optional unless specified as *required*.

  - ``label_encoder`` or ``LabelEncoder``: Convert every enum into the integer of its index (for example, level 0 -> 0, level 1 -> 1, etc.). This is useful for keeping the number of columns small for XGBoost or DeepLearning, where the algorithm otherwise performs ExplicitOneHotEncoding. 
  - ``sort_by_response`` or ``SortByResponse``: Reorders the levels by the mean response (for example, the level with lowest response -> 0, the level with second-lowest response -> 1, etc.). Note that this requires a specified response column.

   - ``AUTO`` (default; uses ``Random``)
   - ``Random``
   - ``Modulo`` (`read more about Modulo <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation>`__)
   - ``Stratified`` (which will stratify the folds based on the response variable for classification problems)

-  `fold_column <algo-params/fold_column.html>`__: Specify the column that contains the cross-validation fold index assignment per observation.

-  `ignore_const_cols <algo-params/ignore_const_cols.html>`__: Specify whether to ignore constant training columns since no information can be gained from them. This option defaults to ``True`` (enabled).

-  `ignored_columns <algo-params/ignored_columns.html>`__: (Python and Flow only) Specify the column or columns to be excluded from the model. In Flow, click the checkbox next to a column name to add it to the list of columns excluded from the model. To add all columns, click the **All** button. To remove a column from the list of ignored columns, click the X next to the column name. To remove all columns from the list of ignored columns, click the **None** button. To search for a specific column, type the column name in the **Search** field above the column list. To only show columns with a specific percentage of missing values, specify the percentage in the **Only show columns with more than 0% missing values** field. To change the selections for the hidden columns, use the **Select Visible** or **Deselect Visible** buttons.

-  `keep_cross_validation_fold_assignment <algo-params/keep_cross_validation_fold_assignment.html>`__: Enable this option to preserve the cross-validation fold assignment. This option defaults to ``False`` (default).

-  `keep_cross_validation_models <algo-params/keep_cross_validation_models.html>`__: Specify whether to keep the cross-validated models. Keeping cross-validation models may consume significantly more memory in the H2O cluster. This option defaults to ``True`` (enabled).

-  `keep_cross_validation_predictions <algo-params/keep_cross_validation_predictions.html>`__: Enable this option to keep the cross-validation predictions. This option defaults to ``False`` (disabled).

-  `model_id <algo-params/model_id.html>`__: Specify a custom name for the model to use as a reference. By default, H2O automatically generates a destination key.

-  `nfolds <algo-params/nfolds.html>`__: Specify the number of folds for cross-validation. This option defaults to ``0`` (no cross-validation).
   
    **Note**: Cross-validation is not supported when ``autoencoder`` is enabled.

-  `offset_column <algo-params/offset_column.html>`__: (Applicable for regression only) Specify a column to use as the offset. 
   
    **Note**: Offsets are per-row "bias values" that are used during model training. For Gaussian distributions, they can be seen as simple corrections to the response (``y``) column. Instead of learning to predict the response (y-row), the model learns to predict the (row) offset of the response column. For other distributions, the offset corrections are applied in the linearized space before applying the inverse link function to get the actual response values. 

-  **quiet_mode**: Specify whether to display less output in the standard output. This option defaults to ``False`` (disabled).

-  `score_each_iteration <algo-params/score_each_iteration.html>`__: Specify whether to score during each iteration of model training. This option defaults to ``False`` (disabled).

-  `seed <algo-params/seed.html>`__: Specify the random number generator (RNG) seed for algorithm components dependent on randomization. The seed is consistent for each H2O instance so that you can create models with the same starting conditions in alternative configurations. This option defaults to ``-1`` (time-based random number).

-  `single_node_mode <algo-params/single_node_mode.html>`__: Specify whether to run on a single node for fine-tuning of model parameters. This option defaults to ``False`` (disabled).

-  `standardize <algo-params/standardize.html>`__: If enabled, automatically standardize the data (mean 0, variance 1). If disabled, the user must provide properly scaled input data. This option defaults to ``True`` (enabled).

-  `stopping_metric <algo-params/stopping_metric.html>`__: Specify the metric to use for early stopping. The available options are:
    
    - ``AUTO`` (This defaults to ``logloss`` for classification and ``deviance`` for regression)
    - ``deviance``
    - ``logloss``
    - ``MSE``
    - ``RMSE``
    - ``MAE``
    - ``RMSLE``
    - ``AUC`` (area under the ROC curve)
    - ``AUCPR`` (area under the Precision-Recall curve)
    - ``lift_top_group``
    - ``misclassification``
    - ``mean_per_class_error``
    - ``custom`` (Python client only)
    - ``custom_increasing`` (Python client only)
    
-  `stopping_rounds <algo-params/stopping_rounds.html>`__: Stops training when the option selected for ``stopping_metric`` doesn't improve for the specified number of training rounds, based on a simple moving average. To disable this feature, specify ``0``. The metric is computed on the validation data (if provided); otherwise, training data is used. This option defaults to ``5``.
   
   **Note**: If cross-validation is enabled:

    - All cross-validation models stop training when the validation metric doesn't improve.
    - The main model runs for the mean number of epochs.
    - N+1 models may be off by the number specified for ``stopping_rounds`` from the best model, but the cross-validation metric estimates the performance of the main model for the resulting number of epochs (which may be fewer than the specified number of epochs).

-  `stopping_tolerance <algo-params/stopping_tolerance.html>`__: Specify the relative tolerance for metric-based stopping to stop training if the improvement is less than this value. This option defaults to ``0``.

-  `training_frame <algo-params/training_frame.html>`__: *Required* Specify the dataset used to build the model. 
    
    **NOTE**: In Flow, if you click the **Build a model** button from the ``Parse`` cell, the training frame is entered automatically.

-  `tweedie_power <algo-params/tweedie_power.html>`__: (Only applicable if ``distribution="tweedie"``) Specify the Tweedie power. You can tune over this option with values > 1.0 and < 2.0, and the default is ``1.5``. For more information, refer to `Tweedie distribution <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tweedie_distribution>`__.

-  `use_all_factor_levels <algo-params/use_all_factor_levels.html>`__: Specify whether to use all factor levels in the possible set of predictors; if you enable this option, sufficient regularization is required. By default, the first factor level is skipped. For Deep Learning models, this option is useful for determining variable importances and is automatically enabled if the autoencoder is selected. This option defaults to ``True`` (enabled).

-  `validation_frame <algo-params/validation_frame.html>`__: Specify the dataset used to evaluate the accuracy of the model.

-  **verbose**: Print scoring history to the console. For Deep Learning, metrics are per epoch. This option defaults to ``False`` (disabled).

-  `weights_column <algo-params/weights_column.html>`__: Specify a column to use for the observation weights, which are used for bias correction. The specified ``weights_column`` must be included in the specified ``training_frame``. 
   
    *Python only*: To use a weights column when passing an H2OFrame to ``x`` instead of a list of column names, the specified ``training_frame`` must contain the specified ``weights_column``. 
   
    **Note**: Weights are per-row observation weights. This is typically the number of times a row is repeated, but non-integer values are supported as well. During training, rows with higher weights matter more, due to the larger loss function pre-factor.

-  `x <algo-params/x.html>`__: Specify a vector containing the names or indices of the predictor variables to use when building the model. If ``x`` is missing, then all columns except ``y`` are used.

-  `y <algo-params/y.html>`__: *Required* Specify the column to use as the dependent variable. The data can be numeric or categorical.

FAQ
~~~

-  **How does the algorithm handle missing values during training?**

 Depending on the selected missing value handling policy, they are either imputed mean or the whole row is skipped. The default behavior is mean imputation. Note that categorical variables are imputed by adding an extra "missing" level. Optionally, Deep Learning can skip all rows with any missing values.

-  **How does the algorithm handle missing values during testing?**

 Missing values in the test set will be mean-imputed during scoring.

-  **What happens if the response has missing values?**

 No errors will occur, but nothing will be learned from rows containing missing the response.

-  **What happens when you try to predict on a categorical level not
   seen during training?**

 For an unseen categorical level in the test set, Deep Learning makes an extra input neuron that remains untrained and contributes some random amount to the subsequent layer.

-  **Does it matter if the data is sorted?**

 Yes, since the training set is processed in order. Depending whether ``train_samples_per_iteration`` is enabled, some rows will be skipped. If ``shuffle_training_data`` is enabled, then each thread that is processing a small subset of rows will process rows randomly, but it is not a global shuffle.

-  **Should data be shuffled before training?**

 Yes, the data should be shuffled before training, especially if the dataset is sorted.

-  **How does the algorithm handle highly imbalanced data in a response
   column?**

 Specify ``balance_classes``, ``class_sampling_factors`` and ``max_after_balance_size`` to control over/under-sampling.

-  **What if there are a large number of columns?**

 The input neuron layer's size is scaled to the number of input features, so as the number of columns increases, the model complexity increases as well.

-  **What if there are a large number of categorical factor levels?**

 This is something to look out for. Say you have three columns: zip code (70k levels), height, and income. The resulting number of internally one-hot encoded features will be 70,002 and only 3 of them will be activated (non-zero). If the first hidden layer has 200 neurons, then the resulting weight matrix will be of size 70,002 x 200, which can take a long time to train and converge. In this case, we recommend either reducing the number of categorical factor levels upfront (e.g., using ``h2o.interaction()`` from R), or specifying ``max_categorical_features`` to use feature hashing to reduce the dimensionality.

-  **How does your Deep Learning Autoencoder work? Is it deep or
   shallow?**

 H2Oâ€™s DL autoencoder is based on the standard deep (multi-layer) neural net architecture, where the entire network is learned together, instead of being stacked layer-by-layer. The only difference is that no response is required in the input and that the output layer has as many neurons as the input layer. If you donâ€™t achieve convergence, then try using the *Tanh* activation and fewer layers. We have some example test scripts `here <https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3/blob/master/h2o-r/tests/testdir_algos/deeplearning/>`__, and even some that show `how stacked auto-encoders can be implemented in R <https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3/blob/master/h2o-r/tests/testdir_algos/deeplearning/runit_deeplearning_stacked_autoencoder_large.R>`__.

-  **When building the model, does Deep Learning use all features or a
   selection of the best features?**

 For Deep Learning, all features are used, unless you manually specify that columns should be ignored. Adding an L1 penalty can make the model sparse, but it is still the full size.

-  **What is the relationship between iterations, epochs, and the
   ``train_samples_per_iteration`` parameter?**

 Epochs measures the amount of training. An iteration is one MapReduce (MR) step - essentially, one pass over the data. The ``train_samples_per_iteration`` parameter is the amount of data to use for training for each MR step, which can be more or less than the number of rows.

-  **When do ``reduce()`` calls occur, after each iteration or each
   epoch?**

 Neither; ``reduce()`` calls occur after every two ``map()`` calls, between threads and ultimately between nodes. There are many ``reduce()`` calls, much more than one per MapReduce step (also known as an "iteration"). Epochs are not related to MR iterations, unless you specify ``train_samples_per_iteration`` as ``0`` or ``-1`` (or to number of rows/nodes). Otherwise, one MR iteration can train with an arbitrary number of training samples (as specified by ``train_samples_per_iteration``).

-  **Does each Mapper task work on a separate neural-net model that is
   combined during reduction, or is each Mapper manipulating a shared
   object that's persistent across nodes?**

 Neither; there's one model per compute node, so multiple Mappers/threads share one model, which is why H2O is not reproducible unless a small dataset is used and ``force_load_balance=F`` or ``reproducible=T``, which effectively rebalances to a single chunk and leads to only one thread to launch a ``map()``. The current behavior is simple model averaging; between-node model averaging via "Elastic Averaging" is currently `in progress <https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3/issues/13535>`__.

-  **Is the loss function and backpropagation performed after each
   individual training sample, each iteration, or at the epoch level?**

 Loss function and backpropagation are performed after each training sample (mini-batch size 1 == online stochastic gradient descent).

-  **When using Hinton's dropout and specifying an input dropout ratio
   of ~20% and ``train_samples_per_iteration`` is set to 50, will each
   of the 50 samples have a different set of the 20% input neurons
   suppressed?**

 Yes - suppression is not done at the iteration level across as samples in that iteration. The dropout mask is different for each training sample.

-  **When using dropout parameters such as ``input_dropout_ratio``, what
   happens if you use only ``Rectifier`` instead of
   ``RectifierWithDropout`` in the activation parameter?**

 The amount of dropout on the input layer can be specified for all activation functions, but hidden layer dropout is only supported is set to ``WithDropout``. The default hidden dropout is 50%, so you don't need to specify anything but the activation type to get good results, but you can set the hidden dropout values for each layer separately.

-  **When using the ``score_validation_sampling`` and
   ``score_training_samples`` parameters, is scoring done at the end of
   the Deep Learning run?**

 The majority of scoring takes place after each MR iteration. After the iteration is complete, it may or may not be scored, depending on two criteria: the time since the last scoring and the time needed for scoring.

 The maximum time between scoring (``score_interval``, default = 5 seconds) and the maximum fraction of time spent scoring (``score_duty_cycle``) independently of loss function, backpropagation, etc.

 Of course, using more training or validation samples will increase the time for scoring, as well as scoring more frequently. For more information about how this affects runtime, refer to the `Deep Learning Performance Guide <https://www.h2o.ai/blog/deep-learning-performance/>`__.

-  **How does the validation frame affect the built neuron network?**

 The validation frame is only used for scoring and does not directly affect the model. However, the validation frame can be used stopping the model early if ``overwrite_with_best_model = T``, which is the default. If this parameter is enabled, the model with the lowest validation error is displayed at the end of the training.

 By default, the validation frame is used to tune the model parameters (such as number of epochs) and will return the best model as measured by the validation metrics, depending on how often the validation metrics are computed (``score_duty_cycle``) and whether the validation frame itself was sampled.

 Model-internal sampling of the validation frame (``score_validation_samples`` and ``score_validation_sampling`` for optional stratification) will affect early stopping quality. If you specify a validation frame but set ``score_validation_samples`` to more than the number of rows in the validation frame (instead of 0, which represents the entire frame), the validation metrics received at the end of training will not be reproducible, since the model does internal sampling.

-  **Are there any best practices for building a model using
   checkpointing?**

 In general, to get the best possible model, we recommend building a model with ``train_samples_per_iteration = -2`` (which is the default value for auto-tuning) and saving it.

 To improve the initial model, start from the previous model and add iterations by building another model, setting the checkpoint to the previous model, and changing ``train_samples_per_iteration``, ``target_ratio_comm_to_comp``, or other parameters.

 If you don't know your model ID because it was generated by R, look it up using ``h2o.ls()``. By default, Deep Learning model names start with ``deeplearning_`` To view the model, use ``m <- h2o.getModel("my_model_id")`` or ``summary(m)``.

 There are a few ways to manage checkpoint restarts:

  *Option 1*: (Multi-node only) Leave ``train_samples_per_iteration = -2``, increase ``target_comm_to_comp`` from 0.05 to 0.25 or 0.5, which provides more communication. This should result in a better model when using multiple nodes. **Note:** This does not affect single-node performance.

  *Option 2*: (Single or multi-node) Set ``train_samples_per_iteration`` to (N), where (N) is the number of training samples used for training by the entire cluster for one iteration. Each of the nodes then trains on (N) randomly-chosen rows for every iteration. The number defined as (N) depends on the dataset size and the model complexity.

  *Option 3*: (Single or multi-node) Change regularization parameters such as ``l1, l2, max_w2, input_droput_ratio`` or ``hidden_dropout_ratios``. We recommend build the first mode using ``RectifierWithDropout``, ``input_dropout_ratio = 0`` (if there is suspected noise in the input), and ``hidden_dropout_ratios=c(0,0,0)`` (for the ability to enable dropout regularization later).

-  **How does class balancing work?**

 The ``max_after_balance_size`` parameter defines the maximum size of the over-sampled dataset. For example, if ``max_after_balance_size = 3``, the over-sampled dataset will not be greater than three times the size of the original dataset.

 For example, if you have five classes with priors of 90%, 2.5%, 2.5%, and 2.5% (out of a total of one million rows) and you oversample to obtain a class balance using ``balance_classes = T``, the result is all four minor classes are oversampled by forty times and the total dataset will be 4.5 times as large as the original dataset (900,000 rows of each class). If ``max_after_balance_size = 3``, all five balance classes are reduced by 3/5 resulting in 600,000 rows each (three million total).

 To specify the per-class over- or under-sampling factors, use ``class_sampling_factors``. In the previous example, the default behavior with ``balance_classes`` is equivalent to ``c(1,40,40,40,40)``, while when ``max_after_balance\size = 3``, the results would be ``c(3/5,40*3/5,40*3/5,40*3/5)``.

 In all cases, the probabilities are adjusted to the pre-sampled space, so the minority classes will have lower average final probabilities than the majority class, even if they were sampled to reach class balance.

-  **How is variable importance calculated for Deep Learning?**

 For Deep Learning, variable importance is calculated using the Gedeon method.

-  **How is deviance computed for a Deep Learning regression model?**

 The following formula is used to compute deviance for a Deep Learning regression model:

   Loss = Quadratic -> MSE==Deviance For Absolute/Laplace or Huber -> MSE != Deviance
