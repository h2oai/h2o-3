I updated my H2O to the newest version. Why can I no longer load a pre-trained model?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When saving an H2O binary model with ``h2o.saveModel`` (R), ``h2o.save_model`` (Python), or in Flow, you will only be able to load and use that saved binary model with the same version of H2O that you used to train your model. H2O binary models are not compatible across H2O versions. If you update your H2O version, then you will need to retrain your model. For production, you can save your model as a :ref:`POJO/MOJO <about-pojo-mojo>`. These artifacts are not tied to a particular version of H2O because they are just plain Java code and do not require an H2O cluster to be running.

--------------

How do I score using an exported JSON model?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since JSON is just a representation format, it cannot be directly
executed, so a JSON export can't be used for scoring. However, you can
score by:

-  including the POJO/MOJO in your execution stream and handing it
   observations one at a time

or

-  handing your data in bulk to an H2O cluster, which will score using
   high throughput parallel and distributed bulk scoring.

--------------

How do I score using an exported POJO?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The generated POJO can be used indepedently of a H2O cluster. First use
``curl`` to send the h2o-genmodel.jar file and the java code for model
to the server. The following is an example; the ip address and model
names will need to be changed.

::

    mkdir tmpdir
    cd tmpdir
    curl http://127.0.0.1:54321/3/h2o-genmodel.jar > h2o-genmodel.jar
    curl http://127.0.0.1:54321/3/Models.java/gbm_model > gbm_model.java

To score a simple .CSV file, download the
`PredictCsv.java <https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3/blob/master/h2o-genmodel/src/main/java/hex/genmodel/tools/PredictCsv.java>`_ file and compile it with the POJO. Make a subdirectory for the compilation (this is useful if you have multiple models to score on).

::

    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/h2oai/h2o-3/master/h2o-genmodel/src/main/java/hex/genmodel/tools/PredictCsv.java
    javac -cp h2o-genmodel.jar -J-Xmx2g -J-XX:MaxPermSize=128m PredictCSV.java gbm_model.java -d gbm_model_dir

Specify the following: 

- the classpath using ``-cp`` 
- the model name (or class) using ``--model`` 
- the csv file you want to score using ``--input`` 
- the location for the predictions using ``--output``.

You must match the table column names to the order specified in the
POJO. The output file will be in a .hex format, which is a lossless text
representation of floating point numbers. Both R and Java will be able
to read the hex strings as numerics.

::

    java -ea -cp h2o-genmodel.jar:gbm_model_dir -Xmx4g -XX:MaxPermSize=256m -XX:ReservedCodeCacheSize=256m hex.genmodel.tools.PredictCsv --header --model gbm_model --input input.csv --output output.csv

--------------

How do I predict using multiple response variables?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Currently, H2O does not support multiple response variables. To predict
different response variables, build multiple models.

--------------

How do I kill any running instances of H2O?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In Terminal, enter ``ps -efww | grep h2o``, then kill any running PIDs.
You can also find the running instance in Terminal and press **Ctrl +
C** on your keyboard. To confirm no H2O sessions are still running, go
to ``http://localhost:54321`` and verify that the H2O web UI does not
display.

--------------

Why is H2O not launching from the command line?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    % Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ExceptionInInitializerError

The only prerequisite for running H2O is a compatible version of `Java <http://docs.h2o.ai/h2o/latest-stable/h2o-docs/welcome.html#java-requirements>`__.

--------------

How does the architecture of H2O work?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This
`PDF <https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-meetups/blob/master/2014_11_18_H2O_in_Big_Data_Environments/H2OinBigDataEnvironments.pdf>`__
includes diagrams and slides depicting how H2O works in big data
environments.

--------------

How does ``importFiles()`` work in H2O?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``importFiles()`` gets the basic information for the file and then
returns a key representing that file. This key is used during parsing to
read in the file and to save space so that the file isn't loaded every
time; instead, it is loaded into H2O then referenced using the key. For
files hosted online, H2O verifies the destination is valid, creates a
vec that loads the file when necessary, and returns a key.

--------------

Does H2O support GPUs?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

GPU support is available in H2O's XGBoost if the following requirements are met:

- NVIDIA GPUs (GPU Cloud, DGX Station, DGX-1, or DGX-2)
- CUDA 8

You can also monitor your GPU utilization via the ``nvidia-smi`` command. Refer to https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-system-management-interface for more information.

In addition to XGBoost H2O also supports GPUs as part of our H2O4GPU offering. Refer to the `H2O4GPU README <https://github.com/h2oai/h2o4gpu/blob/master/README.md>`__ for more information about H2O4GPU.

--------------

Can we make use of GPUs with AutoML?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

XGBoost models in AutoML can make use of GPUs. Keep in mind that the following requirements must be met:

- NVIDIA GPUs (GPU Cloud, DGX Station, DGX-1, or DGX-2)
- CUDA 8

And again, you can monitor your GPU utilization via the ``nvidia-smi`` command. Refer to https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-system-management-interface for more information.

--------------

How can I continue working on a model in H2O after restarting?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are a number of ways you can save your model in H2O:

-  In the web UI, click the **Flow** menu then click **Save Flow**. Your
   flow is saved to the *Flows* tab in the **Help** sidebar on the
   right.
-  In the web UI, click the **Flow** menu then click **Download this
   Flow...**. Depending on your browser and configuration, your flow is
   saved to the "Downloads" folder (by default) or to the location you
   specify in the pop-up **Save As** window if it appears.
-  (For DRF, GBM, and DL models only): Use model checkpointing to resume
   training a model. Copy the ``model_id`` number from a built model and
   paste it into the *checkpoint* field in the ``buildModel`` cell.

--------------

How can I find out more about H2O's real-time, nano-fast scoring engine?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

H2O's scoring engine uses a Plain Old Java Object (POJO). The POJO code
runs quickly but is single-threaded. It is intended for embedding into
lightweight real-time environments.

All the work is done by the call to the appropriate predict method.
There is no involvement from H2O in this case.

To compare multiple models simultaneously, use the POJO to call the
models using multiple threads. For more information on using POJOs,
refer to the `POJO Quick Start Guide <pojo-quick-start.html>`__
and `POJO Java Documentation <../h2o-genmodel/javadoc/index.html>`__

In-H2O scoring is triggered on an existing H2O cluster, typically using
a REST API call. H2O evaluates the predictions in a parallel and
distributed fashion for this case. The predictions are stored into a new
Frame and can be written out using ``h2o.exportFile()``, for example.

What are these RTMP and py\_ temporary Frames? Why are they the same size as my original data?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

No data is copied. H2O does a classic copy-on-write optimization. That
Frame you see - it's nothing more than a thin wrapper over an internal
list of columns; the columns are shared to avoid the copying.

The RTMP's now need to be entirely managed by the H2O wrapper - because
indeed they are using shared state under the hood. If you delete one,
you probably delete parts of others. Instead, temp management should be
automatic and "good" - as in: it's a bug if you need to delete a temp
manually, or if passing around Frames, or adding or removing columns
turns into large data copies.

R's GC is now used to remove unused R temps, and when the last use of a
shared column goes away, then the H2O wrapper will tell the H2O cluster
to remove that no longer needed column.

In other words: Don't delete RTMPs, they'll disappear at the next R GC.
Don't worry about copies (they aren't getting made). Do Nothing and All
Is Well.
