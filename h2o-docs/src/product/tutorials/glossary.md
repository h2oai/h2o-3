**H2O.ai** | Maker of H2O. Visit our [website](http://h2o.ai).  | 
**Autoencoder** | An extension of the Deep Learning framework. Can be used to compress input features (similar to PCA). Sparse autoencoders are simple extensions that can increase accuracy. Use autoencoders for:<br>- generic dimensionality reduction (for pre-processing for any algorithm)<br>-  anomaly detection (for comparing the reconstructed signal with the original to find differences that may be anomalies)<br>- layer-by-layer pre-training (using stacked auto-encoders)
**Backpropogation** | Uses a known, desired output for each input value to calculate the loss function gradient for training. If enabled, performed after each training sample in [**Deep Learning**](#DL). |
**BAD** | A column type that contains only missing values. 
**Balance classes** | A parameter that oversamples the minority classes to balance the distribution. 
**Beta constraints** | A data.frame or H2OParsedData object with the columns ["names", "lower_bounds","upper_bounds", "beta_given"], where each row corresponds to a predictor in the GLM. "names" contains the predictor names, "lower_bounds" and "upper_bounds" are the lower and upper bounds of beta, and "beta_given" is some supplied starting values for beta.
**Binary** | A variable with only two possible outcomes. Refer to [**binomial**](#Binomial).
<a name="Binomial"></a>**Binomial** |  A variable with the value 0 or 1. Binomial variables assigned as 0 indicate that an event hasn't occurred or that the observation lacks a feature, where 1 indicates occurrence or instance of an attribute.
**Bins** | Bins are linear-sized from the observed min-to-max for the subset that is being split. Large bins are enforced for shallow tree depths. Based on the tree decisions, as the tree gets deeper, the bins are distributed symmetrically over the reduced range of each subset. 
<a name="Categorical"></a>**Categorical** | A qualitative, unordered variable (for example, *A*, *B*, *AB*, and *O* would be values for the category *blood type*); synonym for [enumerator](#Enum) or [factor](#Factor). Stored as an `int` column with a `String` mapping in H2O; limited to 10 million unique strings in H2O. 
<a name="Classification"></a>**Classification** | A model whose goal is to predict the category for the [**response**](#Response) input.
**Clip** | In the H2O web UI Flow, a clip is a single cell in a flow containing an action that is saved for later reuse. 
<a name="Cloud"></a>**Cloud** | Synonym for cluster.  Refer to the definition for [cluster](#Cluster). 
<a name="Cluster"></a>**Cluster** | 1. A group of H<sub>2</sub>O nodes that work together; when a job is submitted to a cluster, all the nodes in the cluster work on a portion of the job. Synonym for [**cloud**](#Cloud). <br>2. In statistics, a cluster is a group of observations from a data set identified as similar according to a particular clustering algorithm.</br>

**Key** |  The .hex key generated when data are parsed into H<sub>2</sub>O. In the web-based GUI, **key** is an input on each page where users define models and any page where users validate models on a new data set or use a model to generate predictions.  
**Key/value pair** | A type of data that associates a particular key index to a certain datum.
<a name="KVstore"></a>**Key/value store** | A tool that allows storage of schema-less data. Data usually consists of a string that represents the key, and the data itself, which is the value. Refer also to [**distributed key/value**](#DistKV). 
**L1 regularization** | A regularization method that constrains the absolute value of the weights and has the net effect of dropping some values (setting them to zero) from a model to reduce complexity and avoid overfitting. 
**L2 regularization** | A regularization method that constrains the sum of the squared weights. This method introduces bias into parameter estimates but frequently produces substantial gains in modeling as estimate variance is reduced.

**Real** | A fractional number. 
**ROC Curve** | Graph representing the ratio to true positives to false positives. 
**Scoring history** | Represents the error rate of the model as it is built.
**Seed** | A starting point for randomization. Seed specification is used when machine learning models have a random component; it allows users to recreate the exact "random" conditions used in a model at a later time. 
**Separator** | What separates the entries in the dataset; usually a comma, semicolon, etc.
**Sparse** | A dataset where many of the rows contain blank values or "NA" instead of data.  
**Standard deviation** | The standard deviation of the data in the column, defined as the square root of the sum of the deviance of observed values from the mean divided by the number of elements in the column minus one. Abbreviated *sd*. 
**Standardization** | Transformation of a variable so that it is mean-centered at 0 and scaled by the standard deviation; helps prevent precision problems.

**Validation frame** | The dataset used to evaluate the accuracy of the model. 
**Variable importance** | Represents the statistical significance of each variable in the data in terms of its affect on the model. 
**Weights** | A parameter that specifies certain outcomes as more significant (for example, if you are trying to identify incidence of disease, one "positive" result can be more meaningful than 50 "negative" responses). Higher values indicate more importance.

**Y** | Dependent variable used in GLM; a user-defined input selected from the set of variables present in the user's data. 
**YARN** | Yet Another Resource Manager; used to manage H2O on a Hadoop cluster.
