</li>
<li>[<a href='https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3/issues/12588'>#12588</a>] - Optimized the performance of ingesting large number of small Parquet files by using sequential parse.

</li>
<li>[<a href='https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3/issues/12607'>#12607</a>] - Added a new port_offset command. This parameter lets you specify the relationship of the API port ("web port") and the internal communication port. The previous implementation expected h2o port = api port + 1. Because there are assumptions in the code that the h2o port and API port can be derived from each other, we cannot fully decouple them. Instead, this new option lets the user specify an offset such that h2o port = api port + offset. This enables the user to move the communication port to a specific range, which can be firewalled.
</li>
<li>[<a href='https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3/issues/12620'>#12620</a>] - Improved speed of ingesting data from HTTP/HTTPS data sources in standalone H2O.
</li>

	<li>[<a href='https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3/issues/10755'>#10755</a>] - PCA no longer reports errors when using PCA on wide datasets with `pca_method = Randomized`. Note that it is still not recommended to use Randomized with wide datasets.</li>
	<li>[<a href='https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3/issues/10796'>#10796</a>] - Jenkins builds no longer all share the same R package directory, and new H2O R libraries are installed during testing. </li>
	<li>[<a href='https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3/issues/10801'>#10801</a>] -  When trimming is done, H2O now checks if it passes the beginning of the string. This check prevents the code from going further down the memory with negative indexes.</li>
	<li>[<a href='https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3/issues/10866'>#10866</a>] - Stacked Ensembles no longer fails when the `fold_assignment` for base learners is not `Modulo`. </li>
	<li>[<a href='https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3/issues/10881'>#10881</a>] - Fixed an issue that caused H2O to generate invalid code in POJO for PCA/SVM.</li>
	<li>[<a href='https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3/issues/10969'>#10969</a>] - Instead of using random charset for getting bytes from strings, the source code now centralizes "byte extraction" in StringUtils. This prevents different build machines from using different default encoders.</li>
	<li>[<a href='https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3/issues/10979'>#10979</a>] - When performing a Random Hyperparameter Search, if the model parameter seed is set to the default value but a search_criteria seed is not, then the model parameter seed will now be set to search_criteria seed+0, 1, 2, ..., model_number. Seeding the built models makes random hyperparameter searches more repeatable.</li>
	<li>[<a href='https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3/issues/10989'>#10989</a>] - Fixed a bad link that was included in the "A K/V Store for In-Memory Analytics, Part 2" blog.</li>

	<li>[<a href='https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3/issues/11060'>#11060</a>] - Fixed incorrect parsing of input parameters. Previously, system property parsing logic added the value of any system property other than "ga_opt_out" to the arguments list if a property was prefixed with "ai.h2o.". This caused an attempt to parse the value of a system property as if it were itself a system property and at times resulted in an "Unknown Argument" error. </li>
	<li>[<a href='https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3/issues/11063'>#11063</a>] - Fixed intermittent pyunit_javapredict_dynamic_data_paramsDR. </li>

	<li>[<a href='https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3/issues/11105'>#11105</a>] - The R client `impute` function now checks for categorical values and returns an error if none exist.</li>
	<li>[<a href='https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3/issues/11120'>#11120</a>] - Fixed a filepath issue that occurred on Windows 7 systems when specifying a network drive.</li>
	<li>[<a href='https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3/issues/11123'>#11123</a>] - Added a response column to Stacked Ensembles so that it can be exposed in the Flow UI.</li>

	<li>[<a href='https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3/issues/11189'>#11189</a>] - Explicit 1-hot encoding in FrameUtils no longer generates an invalid order of column names. MissingLevel is now the last column.</li>
	<li>[<a href='https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3/issues/11193'>#11193</a>] - Fixed an issue that caused ModelBuilder to leak xval frames if hyperparameter errors existed. </li>
	<li>[<a href='https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3/issues/11200'>#11200</a>] - Fixed an issue that caused PCA model output to fail to display the Importance of Components.</li>
	<li>[<a href='https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3/issues/11203'>#11203</a>] - When using the H2O Python client, the varimp() function can now be used in PCA to retrieve the Importance of Components details.</li>
	<li>[<a href='https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3/issues/11204'>#11204</a>] - Fixed an issue that caused an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in GLM.</li>
	<li>[<a href='https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3/issues/11205'>#11205</a>] - When a main model is cloned to create the CV models, clearValidationMessages() is now called. Messages are no longer all thrown into a single bucket, which previously caused confusion with the `error_count()`.</li>
	<li>[<a href='https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3/issues/11206'>#11206</a>] - ModelBuilder.message(...) now correctly bumps the error count when the message is an error.</li>

	<li>[<a href='https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3/issues/11210'>#11210</a>] - ModelMetricsRegression._mean_residual_deviance is now exposed. For all algorithms except GLM, this is the mean residual deviance. For GLM, this is the total residual deviance.</li>
	<li>[<a href='https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3/issues/11216'>#11216</a>] - Fixed an issue that caused the`~` operator to fail when used in the Python client. Now, all logical operators set their results as Boolean.</li>

	<li>[<a href='https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3/issues/11220'>#11220</a>] - In GLM, fixed an issue that caused GLM to fail when `quasibinomial` was specified with a link other than the default. Specifying an incorrect link for the quasibinomial family will now result in an error message.</li>
	<li>[<a href='https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3/issues/11239'>#11239</a>] - Improved the doc strings for `sample_rate_per_class` in R and Python.</li>

	<li>[<a href='https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3/issues/11269'>#11269</a>] - When retrieving a Variable Importance plot using the H2O R client, the default number of features shown is now 10 (or all if < 10 exist).</li>
	<li>[<a href='https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3/issues/11302'>#11302</a>] - Fixed an ORC stream parse.</li>

	<li>[<a href='https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3/issues/11430'>#11430</a>] - Fixed a logging issue that caused PID values to be set to an incorrect value. H2O now initializes PID before we initializing SELF_ADDRESS. This change was necessary because initialization of SELF_ADDRESS triggers buffered logged messages to be logged, and PID is part of the log header.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Epic</h4>

<ul>
	<li>[<a href='https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3/issues/10279'>#10279</a>] - Added supported for iSAX 2.0. This algorithm is a time series indexing strategy that reduces the dimensionality of a time series along the time axis. For example, if a time series had 1000 unique values with data across 500 rows, you can reduce this dataset to a time series that uses 100 unique values across 10 buckets along the time span. The following demos are available for more information:

- [GitHub](https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3/commit/8dd11df6e61779e731bcdc6a99684a5e69a7df45): Use typed key when it is necessary. Key.make() now returns typed Key<T extends Keyed>. The trick is that type T can be derived by left side of assignment. If it is not possible to derive type of the Key, then developer has to use typed syntax: `Key.<Frame>make("myframe.hex")` The change simplifies Scala code which will be able to derive type key.

'own_fields' is also now renamed to 'fields'

As a result, the `do_classification` flag is no longer necessary in Flow, since the loss completely specifies the desired behavior, and R users no longer to use `as.factor()` in their response to get the desired bernoulli behavior. The `score_each_iteration` flag has been removed as well. [(github)](https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-dev/commit/cc971e00869197625fefec894ab705c79db05fbb)

As a result, the `do_classification` flag is no longer necessary in Flow, since the loss completely specifies the desired behavior, and R users no longer to use `as.factor()` in their response to get the desired bernoulli behavior. The `score_each_iteration` flag has been removed as well. [(github)](https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-dev/commit/cc971e00869197625fefec894ab705c79db05fbb)
