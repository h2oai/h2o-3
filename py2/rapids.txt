Exec is an interpreter of abstract syntax trees.

Trees have a Lisp-like structure with the following "reserved" special characters:

( is required to have no space to the function definition

works
         '= !x1 (sum ([ $r1 "null" #0) $TRUE)'

doesn't work
        '= !x2 ( sum ([ $r1 "null" #0) $TRUE )'

it means (function  ... ) is the right/only way to specify a function, right?
space between ( and next thing is not allowed

 '('  signals the parser to begin a function application, next token is an identifier or a (single char) flag
 '#'  signals the parser to parse a double: attached_token
 '"'  signals the parser to parse a String (double quote): attached_token
 "'"  signals the parser to parse a String (single quote): attached_token
 '$'  signals a variable lookup: attached_token
 '!'  signals a variable set: attached_token
 '['  signals a column slice by index - R handles all named to int conversions (as well as 1-based to 0-based)

# NO!
#  'f'  signals the parser to a parse a function: (f  name args body).

 '='  signals the parser to assign the RHS to the LHS.
 'g'  signals &gt;
 'G'  signals &gt;=
 'l'  signals &lt;
 'L'  signals &lt;=
 'n'  signals ==
 'N'  signals !=
 '_'  signals negation (!)
 '{'  signals the parser to begin parsing a ';'-separated array of things (ASTSeries is the resulting AST)

In the above, attached_token signals that the special char has extra chars that must be parsed separately. These are
variable names (in the case of $ and !), doubles (in the case of #), or Strings (in the case of ' and ").

Everything else is a function call (prefix/infix/func) and has a leading char of '('.

#************************************************
all operators need to be separated by space?
[ $r1 "null" #0


I don't think we have any a[0] kind of thing in R..all data frames are two dimensional?

(even single columns)?

can you say a[5] for the fifth element of a column? what's that look like to you if so? 

any ( is always paired with a )
The ASTFunc Object

An ASTFunc pulls the function ast produced by the front-end and creates a reference to this function.

A function has a body (which may be empty), and a body is a list of statements.

[] for multiple functions (single too?)

(def f {args} {body})
# got npe when I didn't follow spacing rules
# yup that's all, just the space between `anon` and `{x}` was needed, doesn't matter about spaces after the `{x}`

Separator is ';;' final statement ends with ';;;'

Statements that are possible:

if statements
else statements
for statements
while statements
switch statement
declarative statements
operative statements
return statements

The last statement of a function will return the result of that statement.

Some Rules:
-----------

Every function defines a new Environment that inherits from the current one. Put another way, the calling scope
provides the context for the function to be executed in. Environments can be captured with the `capture` call.

No function shall modify state in any of its parent environments (which includes the DKV store). A function may only
return values to a parent scope.

yeah it's unclear if [ requires ([...)
or if the number of arguments is implied without ()

yes '[' always takes 3 args

arg1 is the frame
arg2 is the rows
arg3 is the cols

okay, {} does a cbind, maybe only for constants? (can there be variables inside {} ?
or can it be anything?


'(' is meant to signal that the next token is some sort of function. So the input is a token that will be looked up in the big list of Ops.

'{' "things" are flagged inputs:

A flag is a special char: ' " $ # are the main ones:

$x means lookup x
"x...   means parse the String with expected end quote "
'x....   means parse the String with expected end quote '
# means parse a number

These are the "things"


All functions will be named. -- I should make this a more explicit rule actually -- good point.

Number of args are defined in parsing of a new function. The rules here are more complicated and I should really write them down so here goes:


H2O learns about a new function as follows:

An AST must be passed to H2O under the "funs" end point.

Here's an example:

f <- function(x,y,z) {
  x <- z[,1]
  y <- x * x * z[,3]
  y - 1
}


ASTs in funs have the following form:

(def name {args} body)

args are a ';'-separated array of tokens -- no special flags necessary here.


body is more complicated:

body is a list of statements in the function body.

statements are separated with ';;'

The last statement ends with ';;;'



Currently disallowing nested function definition at the AST level -- the front end must correctly swap out defs with an invocation.


#***********************************************************************
var is variance
it's a function in R:

var(x, y = NULL, na.rm = FALSE, use)

will look like this:

(var $rf "null" $FALSE "everything")

`use` just says what to do with NAs:

from the R help:

 use: an optional character string giving a method for computing
          covariances in the presence of missing values.  This must be
          (an abbreviation of) one of the strings ‘"everything"’,
          ‘"all.obs"’, ‘"complete.obs"’, ‘"na.or.complete"’, or
          ‘"pairwise.complete.obs"’.

We support "everything" (default), "complete.obs", and "all.obs"

> not sure what the deal is with this one, currently debugging it

I had a question about whether I needed () around the body of the function statements.

It seemed to work with or without

i.e. is the syntax this

(def anon {x} ( (var ...));;;)

or this:

(def anon {x} (var ...);;;)

it matters for deciding what the 2 expression syntax is

this
(def anon {x} ( (var ...);;(var ...));;;)

or this
(def anon {x} (var ...);;(var ...);;;)


or is the syntax something else

you used to have {} in the function body in an old email, I think
that's what was new to me in your example. the function body syntax.


only the last statement becomes global,

example:

function(x) {

z <- x[,1]
y <- z[1,1]

}

technically neither "z" nor "y" should be global, but the value z[1,1] is returned to the outer scope. Looks like I'm allowing key creation within functions to leak to the global space, which is not the intention. I will fix that


The rules are:

Doing an apply over columns: (apply ... #2 ...)

each column has the function applied to it. the result from each column must not produce more than 1 column

Doing an apply over rows: (apply ... #1 ...)

each row may produce 1 or more columns of data



last stmnt can be with or without LHS shouldn't matter

prior statements can have LHS as well. Those LHS should even be able to be referenced in later statements inside the same fcn


#************************************
# cut
#************************************

library(h2o)
h <- h2o.init()
hex <- as.h2o(h, iris)
a <- hex[,1]

cut(a, breaks = c(min(a), mean(a), max(a)), labels = c("a", "b"))


(cut $a {4.3;5.84333333333333;7.9} {"a";"b"} $FALSE $TRUE #3))


arg1: single column vector
arg2: the cuts to make in the vector
arg3: labels for the cuts (always 1 fewer than length of cuts)
arg4: include lowest? (default FALSE)
arg5: right? (default TRUE)
arg6: dig.lab (default 3)


More info on the args here (see ?cut):

       x: a numeric vector which is to be converted to a factor by
          cutting.

  breaks: either a numeric vector of two or more unique cut points or a
          single number (greater than or equal to 2) giving the number
          of intervals into which ‘x’ is to be cut.

  labels: labels for the levels of the resulting category.  By default,
          labels are constructed using ‘"(a,b]"’ interval notation.  If
          ‘labels = FALSE’, simple integer codes are returned instead
          of a factor.

include.lowest: logical, indicating if an ‘x[i]’ equal to the lowest
          (or highest, for ‘right = FALSE’) ‘breaks’ value should be
          included.

   right: logical, indicating if the intervals should be closed on the
          right (and open on the left) or vice versa.

 dig.lab: integer which is used when labels are not given.  It
          determines the number of digits used in formatting the break

#**********************
# objects in h2o-dev

Well not entirely:

Acceptable args are:

numbers: #127882
strings: "asdf", 'asdf'
Frames: $v2, $iris.hex

anything else gets called a vector, but that's not the right name...
