    "This tutorial shows how a H2O [Deep Learning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning) model can be used to do supervised classification and regression. This tutorial covers usage of H2O from Python. An R version of this tutorial will be available as well in a separate document. This file is available in plain R, R markdown, regular markdown, plain Python and iPython Notebook formats, and the plots are available as PDF files. All documents are available [on Github](https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-world-2015-training/raw/master/tutorials/deeplearning/). More examples and explanations can be found in our [H2O Deep Learning booklet](http://h2o.ai/resources/) and on our [H2O Github Repository](http://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3/).\n"

    "### Adaptive Learning Rate\n",
    "By default, H2O Deep Learning uses an adaptive learning rate ([ADADELTA](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1212.5701v1.pdf)) for its stochastic gradient descent optimization. There are only two tuning parameters for this method: `rho` and `epsilon`, which balance the global and local search efficiencies. `rho` is the similarity to prior weight updates (similar to momentum), and `epsilon` is a parameter that prevents the optimization to get stuck in local optima.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Defaults are `rho=0.99` and `epsilon=1e-8`. For cases where convergence speed is very important, it might make sense to perform a few runs to optimize these two parameters (e.g., with `rho in c(0.9,0.95,0.99,0.999)` and `epsilon in c(1e-10,1e-8,1e-6,1e-4)`). Of course, as always with grid searches, caution has to be applied when extrapolating grid search results to a different parameter regime (e.g., for more epochs or different layer topologies or activation functions, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "If `adaptive_rate` is disabled, several manual learning rate parameters become important: `rate`, `rate_annealing`, `rate_decay`, `momentum_start`, `momentum_ramp`, `momentum_stable` and `nesterov_accelerated_gradient`, the discussion of which we leave to [H2O Deep Learning booklet](http://h2o.ai/resources/)."

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##H2O Deep Learning Tips & Tricks\n",
    "####Activation Functions\n",
    "While sigmoids have been used historically for neural networks, H2O Deep Learning implements `Tanh`, a scaled and shifted variant of the sigmoid which is symmetric around 0. Since its output values are bounded by -1..1, the stability of the neural network is rarely endangered. However, the derivative of the tanh function is always non-zero and back-propagation (training) of the weights is more computationally expensive than for rectified linear units, or `Rectifier`, which is `max(0,x)` and has vanishing gradient for `x<=0`, leading to much faster training speed for large networks and is often the fastest path to accuracy on larger problems. In case you encounter instabilities with the `Rectifier` (in which case model building is automatically aborted), try a limited value to re-scale the weights: `max_w2=10`. The `Maxout` activation function is computationally more expensive, but can lead to higher accuracy. It is a generalized version of the Rectifier with two non-zero channels. In practice, the `Rectifier` (and `RectifierWithDropout`, see below) is the most versatile and performant option for most problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "####Generalization Techniques\n",
    "L1 and L2 penalties can be applied by specifying the `l1` and `l2` parameters. Intuition: L1 lets only strong weights survive (constant pulling force towards zero), while L2 prevents any single weight from getting too big. [Dropout](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1207.0580.pdf) has recently been introduced as a powerful generalization technique, and is available as a parameter per layer, including the input layer. `input_dropout_ratio` controls the amount of input layer neurons that are randomly dropped (set to zero), while `hidden_dropout_ratios` are specified for each hidden layer. The former controls overfitting with respect to the input data (useful for high-dimensional noisy data), while the latter controls overfitting of the learned features. Note that `hidden_dropout_ratios` require the activation function to end with `...WithDropout`.\n",
    "\n",
    "####Early stopping and optimizing for lowest validation error\n",
    "By default, Deep Learning training stops when the `stopping_metric` does not improve by at least `stopping_tolerance` (0.01 means 1% improvement) for `stopping_rounds` consecutive scoring events on the training (or validation) data. By default, `overwrite_with_best_model` is enabled and the model returned after training for the specified number of epochs (or after stopping early due to convergence) is the model that has the best training set error (according to the metric specified by `stopping_metric`), or, if a validation set is provided, the lowest validation set error. Note that the training or validation set errors can be based on a subset of the training or validation data, depending on the values for `score_validation_samples` or `score_training_samples`, see below. For early stopping on a predefined error rate on the *training data* (accuracy for classification or MSE for regression), specify `classification_stop` or `regression_stop`.\n",
    "\n",
    "####Training Samples per MapReduce Iteration\n",
    "The parameter `train_samples_per_iteration` matters especially in multi-node operation. It controls the number of rows trained on for each MapReduce iteration. Depending on the value selected, one MapReduce pass can sample observations, and multiple such passes are needed to train for one epoch. All H2O compute nodes then communicate to agree on the best model coefficients (weights/biases) so far, and the model may then be scored (controlled by other parameters below). The default value of `-2` indicates auto-tuning, which attemps to keep the communication overhead at 5% of the total runtime. The parameter `target_ratio_comm_to_comp` controls this ratio. This parameter is explained in more detail in the [H2O Deep Learning booklet](http://h2o.ai/resources/),\n",
    "\n",
    "####Categorical Data\n",
    "For categorical data, a feature with K factor levels is automatically one-hot encoded (horizontalized) into K-1 input neurons. Hence, the input neuron layer can grow substantially for datasets with high factor counts. In these cases, it might make sense to reduce the number of hidden neurons in the first hidden layer, such that large numbers of factor levels can be handled. In the limit of 1 neuron in the first hidden layer, the resulting model is similar to logistic regression with stochastic gradient descent, except that for classification problems, there's still a softmax output layer, and that the activation function is not necessarily a sigmoid (`Tanh`). If variable importances are computed, it is recommended to turn on `use_all_factor_levels` (K input neurons for K levels). The experimental option `max_categorical_features` uses feature hashing to reduce the number of input neurons via the hash trick at the expense of hash collisions and reduced accuracy. Another way to reduce the dimensionality of the (categorical) features is to use `h2o.glrm()`, we refer to the GLRM tutorial for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "####Missing Values\n",
    "H2O Deep Learning automatically does mean imputation for missing values during training (leaving the input layer activation at 0 after standardizing the values). For testing, missing test set values are also treated the same way by default. See the `h2o.impute` function to do your own mean imputation.\n",
    "\n",
    "####Loss functions, Distributions, Offsets, Observation Weights\n",
    "H2O Deep Learning supports advanced statistical features such as multiple loss functions, non-Gaussian distributions, per-row offsets and observation weights.\n",
    "In addition to `Gaussian` distributions and `Squared` loss, H2O Deep Learning supports `Poisson`, `Gamma`, `Tweedie` and `Laplace` distributions. It also supports `Absolute` and `Huber` loss and per-row offsets specified via an `offset_column`. Observation weights are supported via a user-specified `weights_column`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We refer to our [H2O Deep Learning R test code examples](https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3/tree/master/h2o-r/tests/testdir_algos/deeplearning) for more information.\n",
    "a\n",
    "\n",
    "####Reproducibility\n",
    "Every run of DeepLearning results in different results since multithreading is done via [Hogwild!](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~brecht/papers/hogwildTR.pdf) that benefits from intentional lock-free race conditions between threads. To get reproducible results for small datasets and testing purposes, set `reproducible=T` and set `seed=1337` (pick any integer). This will not work for big data for technical reasons, and is probably also not desired because of the significant slowdown (runs on 1 core only).\n",
    "    \n",
    "####Scoring on Training/Validation Sets During Training  \n",
    "The training and/or validation set errors *can* be based on a subset of the training or validation data, depending on the values for `score_validation_samples` (defaults to 0: all) or `score_training_samples` (defaults to 10,000 rows, since the training error is only used for early stopping and monitoring). For large datasets, Deep Learning can automatically sample the validation set to avoid spending too much time in scoring during training, especially since scoring results are not currently displayed in the model returned to R.\n",
    "                                \n",
    "Note that the default value of `score_duty_cycle=0.1` limits the amount of time spent in scoring to 10%, so a large number of scoring samples won't slow down overall training progress too much, but it will always score once after the first MapReduce iteration, and once at the end of training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stratified sampling of the validation dataset can help with scoring on datasets with class imbalance.  Note that this option also requires `balance_classes` to be enabled (used to over/under-sample the training dataset, based on the max. relative size of the resulting training dataset, `max_after_balance_size`):\n",
