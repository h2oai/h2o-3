      "    The H2O Python Module\n",
      "    =====================\n",
      "    \n",
      "    This module provides access to the H2O JVM, as well as its extensions, objects,\n",
      "    machine-learning algorithms, and modeling support capabilities, such as basic\n",
      "    munging and feature generation.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    The H2O JVM uses a web server so that all communication occurs on a socket (specified\n",
      "    by an IP address and a port) via a series of REST calls (see connection.py for the REST\n",
      "    layer implementation and details). There is a single active connection to the H2O JVM at\n",
      "    any time, and this handle is stashed out of sight in a singleton instance of\n",
      "    :class:`H2OConnection` (this is the global  :envvar:`__H2OConn__`). In other words,\n",
      "    this package does not rely on Jython, and there is no direct manipulation of the JVM.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    The H2O python module is not intended as a replacement for other popular machine learning\n",
      "    frameworks such as scikit-learn, pylearn2, and their ilk, but is intended to bring H2O to\n",
      "    a wider audience of data and machine learning devotees who work exclusively with Python.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    H2O from Python is a tool for rapidly turning over models, doing data munging, and\n",
      "    building applications in a fast, scalable environment without any of the mental anguish\n",
      "    about parallelism and distribution of work.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    What is H2O?\n",
      "    ------------\n",
      "    \n",
      "    H2O is a Java-based software for data modeling and general computing. There are many\n",
      "    different perceptions of the H2O software, but the primary purpose of H2O is as a\n",
      "    distributed (many machines), parallel (many CPUs), in memory (several hundred GBs Xmx)\n",
      "    processing engine.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    There are two levels of parallelism:\n",
      "    \n",
      "        * within node\n",
      "        * across (or between) nodes\n",
      "    \n",
      "    The goal, remember, is to easily add more processors to a given problem in order to\n",
      "    produce a solution faster. The conceptual paradigm MapReduce (also known as\n",
      "    \"divide and conquer and combine\"), along with a good concurrent application structure,\n",
      "    (c.f. jsr166y and NonBlockingHashMap) enable this type of scaling in H2O -- we're really\n",
      "    cooking with gas now!\n",
      "    \n",
      "    For application developers and data scientists, the gritty details of thread-safety,\n",
      "    algorithm parallelism, and node coherence on a network are concealed by simple-to-use REST\n",
      "    calls that are all documented here. In addition, H2O is an open-source project under the\n",
      "    Apache v2 licence. All of the source code is on\n",
      "    `github <https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-dev>`_, there is an active\n",
      "    `google group mailing list <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/h2ostream>`_, our\n",
      "    `nightly tests <http://test.0xdata.com/>`_ are open for perusal, and our `JIRA ticketing\n",
      "    system <http://jira.0xdata.com>`_ is also open for public use. Last, but not least, we\n",
      "    regularly engage the machine learning community all over the nation with a very busy\n",
      "    `meetup schedule <http://h2o.ai/events/>`_ (so if you're not in The Valley, no sweat,\n",
      "    we're probably coming to your area soon!), and finally, we host our very own `H2O World\n",
      "    conference <http://h2o.ai/h2o-world/>`_. We also sometimes host hack-a-thons at our\n",
      "    campus in Mountain View, CA. Needless to say, H2O provides a lot of support for\n",
      "    application developers.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    In order to make the most out of H2O, there are some key conceptual pieces that are important\n",
      "    to know before getting started. Mainly, it's helpful to know about the different types of\n",
      "    objects that live in H2O and what the rules of engagement are in the context of the REST\n",
      "    API (which is what any non-JVM interface is all about).\n",

      "    The H2O Object System\n",
      "    +++++++++++++++++++++\n",
      "    \n",
      "    H2O uses a distributed key-value store (the \"DKV\") that contains pointers to the\n",
      "    various objects of the H2O ecosystem. The DKV is a kind of biosphere in that it\n",
      "    encapsulates all shared objects; however, it may not encapsulate all objects. Some shared\n",
      "    objects are mutable by the client; some shared objects are read-only by the client, but are\n",
      "    mutable by H2O (e.g. a model being constructed will change over time); and actions by the\n",
      "    client may have side-effects on other clients (multi-tenancy is not a supported model of\n",
      "    use, but it is possible for multiple clients to attach to a single H2O cloud).\n",
      "    \n",
      "    Briefly, these objects are:\n",
      "    \n",
      "         * :mod:`Key`:    A key is an entry in the DKV that maps to an object in H2O.\n",
      "    \n",
      "         * :mod:`Frame`:  A Frame is a collection of Vec objects. It is a 2D array of elements.\n",
      "    \n",
      "         * :mod:`Vec`:    A Vec is a collection of Chunk objects. It is a 1D array of elements.\n",
      "    \n",
      "         * :mod:`Chunk`:  A Chunk holds a fraction of the BigData. It is a 1D array of elements.\n",
      "    \n",
      "         * :mod:`ModelMetrics`:   A collection of metrics for a given category of model.\n",
      "    \n",
      "         * :mod:`Model`:  A model is an immutable object having `predict` and `metrics` methods.\n",

      "         * :mod:`Job`:    A Job is a non-blocking task that performs a finite amount of work.\n",

    "\n",
    "Model-agnostic gains can be found in improving handling of categorical features. We could experiment with the nbins and nbins_cats settings to control the H2O splitting.The general guidance is to lower the number to increase generalization (avoid overfitting), increase to better fit the distribution.  \n",
    " \n",
    "A good example of adjusting this value is for nbins_cats to be increased to match the number of values in a category. Though usually unnecessary, this can improve performance if a problem has a very important categorical predictor.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "With regards to our Random Forest, we could further experiment with deeper trees or a higher percentage of columns used (mtries).  \n",
    "\n",
    "The GBM can be set to converge a slower for optimal accuracy. If we were to relax our runtime requirements a little bit, we could balance the learn rate and number of trees used.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In a production setting where fine-grain accuracy is beneficial, it is common to set the learn rate to a very small number, such as 0.01 or smaller, and add trees to match.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Use of early stopping is very powerful in allowing the setting of a low learning rate and the building as many trees as needed until the desired convergence is met."
