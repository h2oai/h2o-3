Classes for communication with backend H2O servers.

:class:`H2OConnection`
    Connect to an existing H2O server and send requests to it.

:class:`H2OLocalServer`
    Start an H2O server on your local machine.

:class:`H2OCluster`
    Handle to the remote H2O cluster -- used mainly to retrieve information about it.

The :mod:`h2o` module has convenience functions for accessing these classes, and those are the ones that are
recommended for everyday use. The following are the most common use cases:

(1) Connect to an existing remote H2O server::

        h2o.connect(url="...")

(2) Connect to a local server, or if there isn't one, start it and then connect::

        h2o.init()

(3) Start multiple H2O servers locally (forming a cluster), and then connect to one of them::

        from h2o.backend import H2OLocalServer
        for _ in range(5):
            hs = H2OLocalServer.start()
        h2o.connect(server=hs)

Functions :func:`h2o.connect` and :func:`h2o.init` take many parameters that allow you to fine-tune the connection
settings. When used, they will create a new :class:`H2OConnection` object and store it in a global variable -- this
connection will be used by all subsequent calls to ``h2o.`` functions. Currently, there is no effective way to
have multiple connections to separate H2O servers open at the same time. Such facility may be added in the future.
