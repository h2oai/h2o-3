You can find developer documentation as part of artifacts from each build.
These artifacts are reachable from the [H2O download page](http://h2o.ai/download).  A shortcut to the latest stable docs release can be found at the [H2O docs page](<http://docs.h2o.ai>).

Additionally, there is some more low-level developer documentation in github:

* The top-level Github [README.md](README.md) for developers getting started
* Some starter [API examples](h2o-docs/src/api/README.md) (Needs work!)
* Additional [developer documentation](h2o-docs/src/dev/README.md)
