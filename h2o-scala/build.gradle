// The default 'test' behavior is broken in that it does not grok clusters.
// For H2O, all tests need to be run on a cluster, where each JVM is
// "free-running" - it's stdout/stderr are NOT hooked by another process.  If
// they are hooked (e.g., by the gradle driver process) then the stdout/err get
// buffered and when all CPUs are maxed out (happens over a large fraction of
// the test run) no output is visible.  If the JVMs then crash (again, common
// enough), we get NO output for the test run.  So instead we need to arrange a
// complete cluster of free-running JVMs and redirect all output (at the OS
// level) to files - then scrape the files later for test results.
