H2O is an in-memory platform for distributed, scalable machine learning. H2O uses familiar interfaces like R, Python, Scala, Java, JSON and the Flow notebook/web interface, and works seamlessly with big data technologies like Hadoop and Spark. H2O provides implementations of many popular [algorithms](http://docs.h2o.ai/h2o/latest-stable/h2o-docs/data-science.html) such as Generalized Linear Models (GLM), Gradient Boosting Machines (including XGBoost), Random Forests, Deep Neural Networks, Stacked Ensembles, Naive Bayes, Generalized Additive Models (GAM), Cox Proportional Hazards, K-Means, PCA, Word2Vec, as well as a fully automatic machine learning algorithm ([H2O AutoML](http://docs.h2o.ai/h2o/latest-stable/h2o-docs/automl.html)). 

H2O is extensible so that developers can add data transformations and custom algorithms of their choice and access them through all of those clients.  H2O models can be [downloaded](http://docs.h2o.ai/h2o/latest-stable/h2o-docs/save-and-load-model.html) and loaded into H2O memory for scoring, or exported into POJO or MOJO format for extemely fast scoring in [production](http://docs.h2o.ai/h2o/latest-stable/h2o-docs/productionizing.html).  More information can be found in the [H2O User Guide](http://docs.h2o.ai/h2o/latest-stable/h2o-docs/index.html).

H2O-3 (this repository) is the third incarnation of H2O, and the successor to [H2O-2](https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-2).

<a name="Downloading"></a>
## 1. Downloading H2O-3

While most of this README is written for developers who do their own builds, most H2O users just download and use a pre-built version.  If you are a Python or R user, the easiest way to install H2O is via [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/h2o) or [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/h2oai/h2o) (for Python) or [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=h2o) (for R):  

### Python

```bash
pip install h2o
```

### R

```r
install.packages("h2o")
```

For the latest stable, nightly, Hadoop (or Spark / Sparkling Water) releases, or the stand-alone H2O jar, please visit: [https://h2o.ai/download](https://h2o.ai/download)

More info on downloading & installing H2O is available in the [H2O User Guide](http://docs.h2o.ai/h2o/latest-stable/h2o-docs/downloading.html).

<a name="Resources"></a>
## 2. Open Source Resources

Most people interact with three or four primary open source resources:  **GitHub** (which you've already found), **GitHub issues** (for bug reports and issue tracking), **Stack Overflow** for H2O code/software-specific questions, and **h2ostream** (a Google Group / email discussion forum) for questions not suitable for Stack Overflow.  There is also a **Gitter** H2O developer chat group, however for archival purposes & to maximize accessibility, we'd prefer that standard H2O Q&A be conducted on Stack Overflow.

<a name="IssueTracking"></a>
### 2.1 Issue Tracking and Feature Requests

You can browse and create new issues in our GitHub repository:  <https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3>

*  You can **browse** and search for **issues** without logging in to Github:

## 3. Using H2O-3 Artifacts

Every nightly build publishes R, Python, Java, and Scala artifacts to a build-specific repository.  In particular, you can find Java artifacts in the maven/repo directory.

Here is an example snippet of a gradle build file using h2o-3 as a dependency.  Replace x, y, z, and nnnn with valid numbers.

```
// h2o-3 dependency information
def h2oBranch = 'master'
def h2oBuildNumber = 'nnnn'
def h2oProjectVersion = "x.y.z.${h2oBuildNumber}"

repositories {
  // h2o-3 dependencies
  maven {
    url "https://s3.amazonaws.com/h2o-release/h2o-3/${h2oBranch}/${h2oBuildNumber}/maven/repo/"
  }
}

dependencies {
  compile "ai.h2o:h2o-core:${h2oProjectVersion}"
  compile "ai.h2o:h2o-algos:${h2oProjectVersion}"
  compile "ai.h2o:h2o-web:${h2oProjectVersion}"
  compile "ai.h2o:h2o-app:${h2oProjectVersion}"
}
```

Refer to the latest H2O-3 bleeding edge [nightly build page](http://s3.amazonaws.com/h2o-release/h2o-3/master/latest.html) for information about installing nightly build artifacts.

Refer to the [h2o-droplets GitHub repository](https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-droplets) for a working example of how to use Java artifacts with gradle.

> Note: Stable H2O-3 artifacts are periodically published to Maven Central ([click here to search](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cai.h2o)) but may substantially lag behind H2O-3 Bleeding Edge nightly builds.


<a name="Building"></a>
## 4. Building H2O-3

Getting started with H2O development requires [JDK 1.8+](http://docs.h2o.ai/h2o/latest-stable/h2o-docs/welcome.html#java-requirements), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), [Gradle](https://gradle.org/), [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [R](http://www.r-project.org/).  We use the Gradle wrapper (called `gradlew`) to ensure up-to-date local versions of Gradle and other dependencies are installed in your development directory.

### 4.1. Before building

Building `h2o` requires a properly set up R environment with [required packages](#InstallRPackagesInUnix) and Python environment with the following packages:

```
grip
tabulate
requests
wheel
```

To install these packages you can use [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) or [conda](https://conda.io/).
If you have troubles installing these packages on *Windows*, please follow section [Setup on Windows](#SetupWin) of this guide.
> (Note: It is recommended to use some virtual environment such as [VirtualEnv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/), to install all packages. )


### 4.2. Building from the command line (Quick Start)

To build H2O from the repository, perform the following steps.


#### Recipe 1: Clone fresh, build, skip tests, and run H2O

```
# Build H2O
git clone https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3.git
cd h2o-3
./gradlew build -x test

You may encounter problems: e.g. npm missing. Install it:
brew install npm

# Start H2O
java -jar build/h2o.jar

# Point browser to http://localhost:54321

```

#### Recipe 2: Clone fresh, build, and run tests (requires a working install of R)

```
git clone https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3.git
cd h2o-3
./gradlew syncSmalldata
./gradlew syncRPackages
./gradlew build
```

>**Notes**:
>
> - Running tests starts five test JVMs that form an H2O cluster and requires at least 8GB of RAM (preferably 16GB of RAM).
> - Running `./gradlew syncRPackages` is supported on Windows, OS X, and Linux, and is strongly recommended but not required. `./gradlew syncRPackages` ensures a complete and consistent environment with pre-approved versions of the packages required for tests and builds. The packages can be installed manually, but we recommend setting an ENV variable and using `./gradlew syncRPackages`. To set the ENV variable, use the following format (where `${WORKSPACE} can be any path):
>  
> ```
> mkdir -p ${WORKSPACE}/Rlibrary
> export R_LIBS_USER=${WORKSPACE}/Rlibrary
> ```

#### Recipe 3:  Pull, clean, build, and run tests

```
git pull
./gradlew syncSmalldata
./gradlew syncRPackages
./gradlew clean
./gradlew build
```

#### Notes

 - We recommend using `./gradlew clean` after each `git pull`.

- Skip tests by adding `-x test` at the end the gradle build command line.  Tests typically run for 7-10 minutes on a Macbook Pro laptop with 4 CPUs (8 hyperthreads) and 16 GB of RAM.

- Syncing smalldata is not required after each pull, but if tests fail due to missing data files, then try `./gradlew syncSmalldata` as the first troubleshooting step.  Syncing smalldata downloads data files from AWS S3 to the smalldata directory in your workspace.  The sync is incremental.  Do not check in these files.  The smalldata directory is in .gitignore.  If you do not run any tests, you do not need the smalldata directory.
- Running `./gradlew syncRPackages` is supported on Windows, OS X, and Linux, and is strongly recommended but not required. `./gradlew syncRPackages` ensures a complete and consistent environment with pre-approved versions of the packages required for tests and builds. The packages can be installed manually, but we recommend setting an ENV variable and using `./gradlew syncRPackages`. To set the ENV variable, use the following format (where `${WORKSPACE}` can be any path):

  ```
  mkdir -p ${WORKSPACE}/Rlibrary
  export R_LIBS_USER=${WORKSPACE}/Rlibrary
  ```

#### Recipe 4:  Just building the docs

```
./gradlew clean && ./gradlew build -x test && (export DO_FAST=1; ./gradlew dist)
open target/docs-website/h2o-docs/index.html
```

#### Recipe 5:  Building using a Makefile

Root of the git repository contains a Makefile with convenient shortcuts for frequent build targets used in development.
To build `h2o.jar` while skipping tests and also the building of alternative assemblies, execute 

```
make
```

To build `h2o.jar` using the minimal assembly, run
```
make minimal
```

The minimal assembly is well suited for developement of H2O machine learning algorithms. It doesn't bundle some heavyweight
dependencies (like Hadoop) and using it saves build time as well as need to download large libraries from Maven repositories.

<a name="SetupWin"></a>
### 4.3. Setup on Windows

##### Step 1: Download and install [WinPython](https://winpython.github.io).
  From the command line, validate `python` is using the newly installed package by using `which python` (or `sudo which python`). [Update the Environment variable](https://github.com/winpython/winpython/wiki/Environment) with the WinPython path.

##### Step 2: Install required Python packages:

    pip install grip tabulate wheel

##### Step 3: Install JDK

Install [Java 1.8+](http://docs.h2o.ai/h2o/latest-stable/h2o-docs/welcome.html#java-requirements) and add the appropriate directory `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_65\bin` with java.exe to PATH in Environment Variables. To make sure the command prompt is detecting the correct Java version, run:

    javac -version

The CLASSPATH variable also needs to be set to the lib subfolder of the JDK:

    CLASSPATH=/<path>/<to>/<jdk>/lib

##### Step 4. Install Node.js

Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/) and add the installed directory `C:\Program Files\nodejs`, which must include node.exe and npm.cmd to PATH if not already prepended.

##### Step 5. Install R, the required packages, and Rtools:

Install [R](http://www.r-project.org/) and add the bin directory to your PATH if not already included.

<a name="InstallRPackagesInUnix"></a>
Install the following R packages:

- [RCurl](http://cran.r-project.org/package=RCurl)
- [jsonlite](http://cran.r-project.org/package=jsonlite)
- [statmod](http://cran.r-project.org/package=statmod)
- [devtools](http://cran.r-project.org/package=devtools)
- [roxygen2](http://cran.r-project.org/package=roxygen2)
- [testthat](http://cran.r-project.org/package=testthat)

To install these packages from within an R session:

```r
pkgs <- c("RCurl", "jsonlite", "statmod", "devtools", "roxygen2", "testthat")
for (pkg in pkgs) {
  if (! (pkg %in% rownames(installed.packages()))) install.packages(pkg)
}
```
Note that [libcurl](http://curl.haxx.se) is required for installation of the **RCurl** R package.

Note that this packages don't cover running tests, they for building H2O only.

Finally, install [Rtools](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/), which is a collection of command line tools to facilitate R development on Windows.
>**NOTE**: During Rtools installation, do **not** install Cygwin.dll.

##### Step 6. Install [Cygwin](https://cygwin.com/setup-x86_64.exe)
**NOTE**: During installation of Cygwin, deselect the Python packages to avoid a conflict with the Python.org package.

###### Step 6b. Validate Cygwin
If Cygwin is already installed, remove the Python packages or ensure that Native Python is before Cygwin in the PATH variable.

##### Step 7. Update or validate the Windows PATH variable to include R, Java JDK, Cygwin.

##### Step 8. Git Clone [h2o-3](https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3.git)

If you don't already have a Git client, please install one.  The default one can be found here http://git-scm.com/downloads.  Make sure that command prompt support is enabled before the installation.

Download and update h2o-3 source codes:

    git clone https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3

##### Step 9. Run the top-level gradle build:

    cd h2o-3
    ./gradlew.bat build

> If you encounter errors run again with `--stacktrace` for more instructions on missing dependencies.


### 4.4. Setup on OS X

If you don't have [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/), we recommend installing it.  It makes package management for OS X easy.

##### Step 1. Install JDK

Install [Java 1.8+](http://docs.h2o.ai/h2o/latest-stable/h2o-docs/welcome.html#java-requirementsl). To make sure the command prompt is detecting the correct Java version, run:

    javac -version

##### Step 2. Install Node.js:

Using Homebrew:

    brew install node

Otherwise, install from the [NodeJS website](http://nodejs.org/download/).

##### Step 3. Install R and the required packages:

Install [R](http://www.r-project.org/) and add the bin directory to your PATH if not already included.

<a name="InstallRPackagesInUnix"></a>
Install the following R packages:

- [RCurl](http://cran.r-project.org/package=RCurl)
- [jsonlite](http://cran.r-project.org/package=jsonlite)
- [statmod](http://cran.r-project.org/package=statmod)
- [devtools](http://cran.r-project.org/package=devtools)
- [roxygen2](http://cran.r-project.org/package=roxygen2)
- [testthat](http://cran.r-project.org/package=testthat)

To install these packages from within an R session:

```r
pkgs <- c("RCurl", "jsonlite", "statmod", "devtools", "roxygen2", "testthat")
for (pkg in pkgs) {
  if (! (pkg %in% rownames(installed.packages()))) install.packages(pkg)
}
```
Note that [libcurl](http://curl.haxx.se) is required for installation of the **RCurl** R package.

Note that this packages don't cover running tests, they for building H2O only.

##### Step 4. Install python and the required packages:

Install python:

    brew install python

Install pip package manager:

    sudo easy_install pip

Next install required packages:

    sudo pip install wheel requests tabulate  

##### Step 5. Git Clone [h2o-3](https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3.git)

OS X should already have Git installed. To download and update h2o-3 source codes:

    git clone https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3

##### Step 6. Run the top-level gradle build:

    cd h2o-3
    ./gradlew build

Note: on a regular machine it may take very long time (about an hour) to run all the tests.

> If you encounter errors run again with `--stacktrace` for more instructions on missing dependencies.

### 4.5. Setup on Ubuntu 14.04

##### Step 1. Install Node.js

    curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_0.12 | sudo bash -
    sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

##### Step 2. Install JDK:

Install [Java 8](http://docs.h2o.ai/h2o/latest-stable/h2o-docs/welcome.html#java-requirements). Installation instructions can be found here [JDK installation](http://askubuntu.com/questions/56104/how-can-i-install-sun-oracles-proprietary-java-jdk-6-7-8-or-jre). To make sure the command prompt is detecting the correct Java version, run:

    javac -version

##### Step 3. Install R and the required packages:

Installation instructions can be found here [R installation](http://cran.r-project.org).  Click “Download R for Linux”.  Click “ubuntu”.  Follow the given instructions.

To install the required packages, follow the [same instructions as for OS X above](#InstallRPackagesInUnix).

>**Note**: If the process fails to install RStudio Server on Linux, run one of the following:
>
>`sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev`
>
>or
>
>`sudo apt-get install libcurl4-gnutls-dev`

##### Step 4. Git Clone [h2o-3](https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3.git)

If you don't already have a Git client:

    sudo apt-get install git

Download and update h2o-3 source codes:

    git clone https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3

##### Step 5. Run the top-level gradle build:

    cd h2o-3
    ./gradlew build

> If you encounter errors, run again using `--stacktrace` for more instructions on missing dependencies.

> Make sure that you are not running as root, since `bower` will reject such a run.

### 4.6. Setup on Ubuntu 13.10

##### Step 1. Install Node.js

    curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_16.x | sudo bash -
    sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

##### Steps 2-4. Follow steps 2-4 for Ubuntu 14.04 (above)

<a name="Launching"></a>

## 5. Launching H2O after Building

To start the H2O cluster locally, execute the following on the command line:

    java -jar build/h2o.jar

A list of available start-up JVM and H2O options (e.g. `-Xmx`, `-nthreads`, `-ip`), is available in the [H2O User Guide](http://docs.h2o.ai/h2o/latest-stable/h2o-docs/starting-h2o.html#from-the-command-line).

<a name="BuildingHadoop"></a>
## 6. Building H2O on Hadoop

Pre-built H2O-on-Hadoop zip files are available on the [download page](http://h2o.ai/download).  Each Hadoop distribution version has a separate zip file in h2o-3.

To build H2O with Hadoop support yourself, first install sphinx for python: `pip install sphinx`
Then start the build by entering  the following from the top-level h2o-3 directory:

    export BUILD_HADOOP=1;
    ./gradlew build -x test;
    ./gradlew dist;

This will create a directory called 'target' and generate zip files there.  Note that `BUILD_HADOOP` is the default behavior when the username is `jenkins` (refer to `settings.gradle`); otherwise you have to request it, as shown above.

To build the zip files only for selected distributions use the `H2O_TARGET` env variable together with `BUILD_HADOOP`, for example:

    export BUILD_HADOOP=1;
    export H2O_TARGET=hdp2.5,hdp2.6
    ./gradlew build -x test;
    ./gradlew dist;

### Adding support for a new version of Hadoop

In the `h2o-hadoop` directory, each Hadoop version has a build directory for the driver and an assembly directory for the fatjar.

You need to:

1.  Add a new driver directory and assembly directory (each with a `build.gradle` file) in `h2o-hadoop`
2.  Add these new projects to `h2o-3/settings.gradle`
3.  Add the new Hadoop version to `HADOOP_VERSIONS` in `make-dist.sh`
4.  Add the new Hadoop version to the list in `h2o-dist/buildinfo.json`


### Secure user impersonation

Hadoop supports [secure user impersonation](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r2.7.3/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/Superusers.html) through its Java API.  A kerberos-authenticated user can be allowed to proxy any username that meets specified criteria entered in the NameNode's core-site.xml file.  This impersonation only applies to interactions with the Hadoop API or the APIs of Hadoop-related services that support it (this is not the same as switching to that user on the machine of origin).

Setting up secure user impersonation (for h2o):

1.  Create or find an id to use as proxy which has limited-to-no access to HDFS or related services; the proxy user need only be used to impersonate a user
2.  (Required if not using h2odriver) If you are not using the driver (e.g. you wrote your own code against h2o's API using Hadoop), make the necessary code changes to impersonate users (see [org.apache.hadoop.security.UserGroupInformation](http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r2.8.0/api/org/apache/hadoop/security/UserGroupInformation.html))
3.  In either of Ambari/Cloudera Manager or directly on the NameNode's core-site.xml file, add 2/3 properties for the user we wish to use as a proxy (replace <proxyusername> with the simple user name - not the fully-qualified principal name).
    * `hadoop.proxyuser.<proxyusername>.hosts`: the hosts the proxy user is allowed to perform impersonated actions on behalf of a valid user from
    * `hadoop.proxyuser.<proxyusername>.groups`: the groups an impersonated user must belong to for impersonation to work with that proxy user
    * `hadoop.proxyuser.<proxyusername>.users`: the users a proxy user is allowed to impersonate
    * Example: ```

4.  Restart core services such as HDFS & YARN for the changes to take effect

Impersonated HDFS actions can be viewed in the hdfs audit log ('auth:PROXY' should appear in the `ugi=` field in entries where this is applicable).  YARN similarly should show 'auth:PROXY' somewhere in the Resource Manager UI.


To use secure impersonation with h2o's Hadoop driver:

*Before this is attempted, see Risks with impersonation, below*

When using the h2odriver (e.g. when running with `hadoop jar ...`), specify `-principal <proxy user kerberos principal>`, `-keytab <proxy user keytab path>`, and `-run_as_user <hadoop username to impersonate>`, in addition to any other arguments needed.  If the configuration was successful, the proxy user will log in and impersonate the `-run_as_user` as long as that user is allowed by either the users or groups configuration property (configured above); this is enforced by HDFS & YARN, not h2o's code.  The driver effectively sets its security context as the impersonated user so all supported Hadoop actions will be performed as that user (e.g. YARN, HDFS APIs support securely impersonated users, but others may not).

#### Precautions to take when leveraging secure impersonation

*  The target use case for secure impersonation is applications or services that pre-authenticate a user and then use (in this case) the h2odriver on behalf of that user.  H2O's Steam is a perfect example: auth user in web app over SSL, impersonate that user when creating the h2o YARN container.
*  The proxy user should have limited permissions in the Hadoop cluster; this means no permissions to access data or make API calls.  In this way, if it's compromised it would only have the power to impersonate a specific subset of the users in the cluster and only from specific machines.
*  Use the `hadoop.proxyuser.<proxyusername>.hosts` property whenever possible or practical.
*  Don't give the proxyusername's password or keytab to any user you don't want to impersonate another user (this is generally *any* user).  The point of impersonation is not to allow users to impersonate each other.  See the first bullet for the typical use case.
*  Limit user logon to the machine the proxying is occurring from whenever practical.
*  Make sure the keytab used to login the proxy user is properly secured and that users can't login as that id (via `su`, for instance)
*  Never set hadoop.proxyuser.<proxyusername>.{users,groups} to '*' or 'hdfs', 'yarn', etc.  Allowing any user to impersonate hdfs, yarn, or any other important user/group should be done with extreme caution and *strongly* analyzed before it's allowed.

#### Risks with secure impersonation

*  The id performing the impersonation can be compromised like any other user id.
*  Setting any `hadoop.proxyuser.<proxyusername>.{hosts,groups,users}` property to '*' can greatly increase exposure to security risk.
*  When users aren't authenticated before being used with the driver (e.g. like Steam does via a secure web app/API), auditability of the process/system is difficult.

## 7. Sparkling Water

Sparkling Water combines two open-source technologies: Apache Spark and the H2O Machine Learning platform.  It makes H2O’s library of advanced algorithms, including Deep Learning, GLM, GBM, K-Means, and Distributed Random Forest, accessible from Spark workflows. Spark users can select the best features from either platform to meet their Machine Learning needs.  Users can combine Spark's RDD API and Spark MLLib with H2O’s machine learning algorithms, or use H2O independently of Spark for the model building process and post-process the results in Spark.

## 8. Documentation

### Documenation Homepage

The main H2O documentation is the [H2O User Guide](http://docs.h2o.ai/h2o/latest-stable/h2o-docs/index.html).  Visit <http://docs.h2o.ai> for the top-level introduction to documentation on H2O projects.


### Generate REST API documentation

To generate the REST API documentation, use the following commands:

    cd ~/h2o-3
    cd py
    python ./generate_rest_api_docs.py  # to generate Markdown only
    python ./generate_rest_api_docs.py --generate_html  --github_user GITHUB_USER --github_password GITHUB_PASSWORD # to generate Markdown and HTML

The default location for the generated documentation is `build/docs/REST`.

If the build fails, try `gradlew clean`, then `git clean -f`.

### Bleeding edge build documentation

Documentation for each bleeding edge nightly build is available on the [nightly build page](http://s3.amazonaws.com/h2o-release/h2o/master/latest.html).
