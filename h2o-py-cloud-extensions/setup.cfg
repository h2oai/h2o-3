# E241: (Multiple spaces after ':' or ',') Occasionally aligning code fragments vertically improves readability
# E265: (Block comment should start with '# ') I like having banner comments of the form #---------------------
# E302: (Functions should be separated with 2 blank lines) PEP8 says that sometimes groups of related functions may be
#       separated with 3 lines to improve readability. We do that.
# E303: (Classes should be separated with ? blank lines) "Spare is better than dense". Extra separators don't hurt.
# E701: (Multiple statements on the same line) PEP8 allows multiple statements on the same line in certain situations,
#       for example `if foo: continue` is more readable in 1 line than in 2.
#
# D105: (Missing docstring in magic method) Magic methods have well-defined meaning, docstrings are redundant.
